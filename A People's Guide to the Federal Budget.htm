why A Citizen’s Guide to the Federal Budget was created...We hope to make the
budget more accessible and understandable.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Since 2001 taxpayers have had to
fend for themselves in efforts to make the budget more accessible and
understandable. Yet we still care a lot about how the government spends our
money, perhaps now more than ever. National Priorities Project (NPP) believes
that all people affected by federal spending priorities should have the ability
and opportunity to shape our nation's budget. To that end, NPP strives to make
complex federal budget information transparent and accessible so people can
prioritize and influence how their tax dollars are spent. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>So, how much do you know about
the federal budget? If your answer is &#8213;not much,&#8214; you’re not alone.
Virtually no one knows everything about how the government will spend the $3.7
trillion dollars that the Obama Administration has proposed spending in FY2012,
or even how our elected officials in Washington will decide who will get how
much as they slice up the federal budget pie. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That's why at NPP the question is

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>NPP's &#8213;A People's Guide to

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>First, that $3.7 trillion the
government is planning to spend in FY2012 is mostly your money. We contribute
about 60 percent of the government’s total revenues each year (not including
borrowing) through individual income taxes and payroll deductions for such
things as Social Security and Medicare. This means we are all stakeholders in
the government’s decisions about how this money will be spent. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:107%'> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Second, it is important to
remember that there is a flow-through of money from the federal government to
the states and back down to the individual. Federal funding comes back into our
communities in many ways, much of it in the form of actual funds, often
funneled through state and local agencies or programs. Each year the federal
government provides hundreds of billions of dollars to states through grants
and assistance programs. Programs like the Special Supplemental Nutrition
Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) provide assistance to
individuals and families, while others like the Community Development Block
Grant (CDBG) program allow communities to fund important public and private
infrastructure. Many of these programs are critical to states and their
citizens, particularly now, as the current difficult economic climate is
forcing states to make tough budget choices. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:0in;

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Federal funds also land in our
communities by supporting government services and the enforcement of safety
regulations for things like food quality, drinking water, and clean air. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:107%'> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>As stakeholders, it is our right
and our obligation to see that our tax dollars are spent in ways that truly
reflect our priorities. To do that we need to know where that money is going,
and how budget decisions are made. We need to be smart about the federal
budget. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Ideally, the federal budget is a

line-height:107%'> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>In the 1920s, the federal
government spent less than $120 billion in today's dollars (i.e., adjusted for
inflation). This was only around ten percent of the GDP. Federal spending did
not play much of a role in the economy. The government did play an important
role through other means, though. For example, the government gave public land
to railroad companies in order to speed the &#8213;opening of the west,&#8214;
and set low mining fees on public lands to encourage mining. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:107%'> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Federal spending increased
significantly around 1933 in response to the Great Depression during President
Franklin D. Roosevelt's &quot;New Deal.&quot; But the most significant
increases came during World War II. In 1944, outlays reached an all time high
of 44 percent of the GDP (see chart below). Other than during World War II, the
peak of federal spending was in 1983 during the Reagan military build-up.
During the 1990s, federal spending did not keep pace with the expansion in the
economy, or population growth, so federal spending fell as a percentage of GDP.
By the end of the decade, federal spending was at a low not seen for almost 35
years. More recently, federal spending has increased due to significant
increases in military spending, rising health care costs, more people retiring
and collecting Social Security, and a greater demand for &#8213;safety
net&#8214; programs such as unemployment compensation and food security
programs. </p>

today accounts for more than 24 percent of GDP. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>About one-third of that spending,
estimated at $1.2 trillion in FY2012, is devoted to Social Security (19 percent
of total federal spending) and Medicare (12 percent) – programs aimed at senior
citizens, the disabled and children and spouses of deceased workers (see chart

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Spending on &#8213;national
defense&#8214; amounts to roughly 18 percent of total federal spending. This
does not include, however, foreign military financing grants, other military
assistance, or other military-related expenditures. NPP does include these
expenditures when it calculates &#8213;military spending,&#8214; which pushes
the total up over 19 percent of all federal spending. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The high deficits in the 1980s

approximately 6 percent of spending, or a projected $242 billion in FY2012. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Total federal revenues for Fiscal
Year 2012 are projected to be about $2.6 trillion. The largest portion, 43
percent, comes from individual income taxes. The next largest share, at 35
percent, comes from collections for social insurance programs like Medicare and
retirement receipts for Social Security and other pensions. The remainder is
made up of corporate income taxes, excise taxes, estate and gift taxes, customs
duties, federal reserve deposits, and some miscellaneous receipts. In years
where revenues fall short of planned spending the government has to borrow the
difference, as shown in the chart below. This borrowing reduces the percentages
of total &quot;revenues&quot; made up by the other sources of federal income. </p>

was driven by a need for more revenues and the top income tax rate rose from 7
percent to 77 percent. From that time on, many changes were made to the tax
code regarding exemptions, deductions, and rates of taxation. During World War
II, more fundamental changes happened: the number of people subject to the
income tax increased ten-fold due to the growth in employment. In addition, the

Over time, more benefits have been added to the list of those funded directly
by employers and employees, including Medicare, which provides health care

different points in time, and now stand at 15.3 percent of income. Employers
and employees each pay 6.2 percent for Social Security and 1.45 percent for
Medicare. However, the Social Security tax only applies to the first $106,800
of income. This makes the Social Security tax regressive since higher-income
taxpayers pay a lower percentage of their income than lower-income taxpayers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>About three-quarters of taxpayers
pay more in payroll taxes (Social Security and Medicare) than they do in
individual income taxes. This is because all wage earners regardless of income
contribute to Social Security and Medicare, while some lowincome earners don’t
make enough to be subject to income taxes, or are taxed at a very low rate.
[NOTE: as part of the December 2010 deal to extend the Bush-era tax cuts for
two years, the employee contribution to Social Security was reduced by 2
percent through the end of 2011.] </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Other taxes such as corporate
income taxes have contributed less and less to total tax revenues over time. As
the chart below indicates, the burden of taxation has increasingly been shifted
from corporations to the individual. Between 1960 and 2010 corporate income
taxes dropped from 23 percent of total federal revenues to 7 percent.
Individual income taxes, on the other hand, have stayed relatively stable.
Other types of taxes – such as excise and customs taxes – have made up the
difference. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Fifty-eight percent of the
proposed discretionary budget for FY2012 is for &quot;military spending,&quot;
which as defined by NPP includes programs other than the Defense Department
commonly thought of as part of the military such as foreign military sales and
international security assistance. Other types of discretionary spending
include education, energy and the environment, many health programs, and
housing assistance. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'><i>Mandatory spending</i>
includes programs, mostly entitlement programs, which are funded by eligibility
rules or payment rules. For example, Congress decides to create a program, in
this case the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly the
Food Stamps program. It then determines who is eligible for the program and any
other criteria it may want to lay out. The amount of money appropriated for the
program each year is then determined by estimates of how many people are
eligible and will actually apply for SNAP. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Unlike discretionary spending,
Congress does not decide each year to increase or decrease the Food Stamp
budget. Instead, it periodically reviews the eligibility rules and may change
them in order to exclude or include more people.  For example, one way to cut
Social Security spending would be to raise the retirement age, thereby reducing
the number of eligible beneficiaries. </p>

Social Security which makes up one-third of mandatory spending, and an
estimated 18 percent of total projected spending in FY2012. Social Security

an older population. The chart below shows the breakdown of different types of

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The federal budget consists of
two main pots of money: trust funds and federal funds.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:107%'> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Trust funds are designated as
such by law. Trust fund monies are generated from sources such as payroll
taxes, and are earmarked for specific programs. For example, a portion of the
Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) tax which is deducted from an
employee's salary (employers also make a contribution) goes into the Social
Security trust fund. Money from this trust fund is then used to pay benefits to
Social Security recipients. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:107%'> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The larger trust funds finance
payments for Social Security, Medicare and unemployment compensation. Other
trust funds finance federal employee retirement, veterans retirement, highway
construction and airport development. There is no set definition of what types
of federal programs should be paid for through a trust fund, and there are a
number of cases where a trust fund finances an activity, while a very similar
activity is financed through federal funds – transportation infrastructure is
one such example. There are over 200 trust funds. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:107%'> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Federal Funds constitute all
other government funds. At roughly two-thirds of federal revenues, the Federal
Fund aggregates revenues from a number of sources. The largest share of Federal
Fund revenues comes from individual income taxes, so the Federal Funds
breakdown can be used to examine how an individual income tax dollar is spent.
Corporate income, excise, estate and gift taxes, other special collections, and
borrowing also finance Federal Fund activities. </p>

these priorities, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which is part of
the Executive Branch and serves as the White House's accountant, so to speak,
gives guidelines to each federal agency instructing them how to prepare their
strategic plans and budgets. The agencies then submit their budget requests and
write documents defending them, known as &#8213;budget justifications.&#8214;

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Once the Administration’s budget
request has been released, Congress begins months of activities reviewing all
aspects of the request. Generally Congress adds funding in certain areas or for
certain programs and reduces it in others. In theory, Congress could ignore the
President’s request entirely and start from scratch. As a practical matter,
however, this rarely happens. Either way, whatever Congress does the President
has to sign it for it to become law. If Congress proposes funding for programs
the White House opposes, the President can veto the bill, and the Congressional
process starts over. In many instances the mere threat of a presidential veto
is enough to get Congress to drop, or at least modify, any offending
provisions. </p>

resolution –</b> After the President submits his budget, the House and Senate
each traditionally prepare &#8213;budget resolutions.&#8214; A budget
resolution is not a binding document, but is more like a blueprint. It provides
a framework for Congress for making budget decisions about spending and taxes.
It sets overall annual spending limits for federal agencies, but does not set
specific spending amounts for particular programs. After the two chambers pass
their budget resolutions, a joint conference is formed to iron out differences
between the two versions which is then voted on by each chamber. NOTE: because
the budget resolution is not a binding document, the budget process can move
forward even if a final version is not adopted by both the House and Senate.
Because they are not laws, budget resolutions do not require a presidential
signature. </p>

subcommittees (12 in the House and 12 in the Senate), known as &#8213;302
allocations.&#8214; If no final version of the budget resolution has been
enacted, then it falls to the members of the appropriations committee to set
overall spending limits. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Each appropriations subcommittee
takes the budget requests and the justification materials submitted by the
agencies under their jurisdiction, conducts hearings and does follow-ups with
agencies to obtain answers to questions about the agency requests. Based on all
of this information, each subcommittee chair writes a first draft of the
subcommittee’s appropriation bill. This is called the &quot;chairman's
mark.&quot; The subcommittee then considers, amends, and finally votes on its
bill and after passage, the bill goes to the full Appropriations committee. The
full committee reviews and sends it to the full House or Senate for floor
consideration. </p>

the conference report – the compromise version – for each bill. Each one is

President, supplemental appropriations are enacted outside the normal budget
process, usually in an expedited manner to provide funding needed before the
enactment of appropriations through the normal process. Supplemental spending
gives Congress flexibility to meet unexpected funding needs. Because it occurs
outside the traditional budget process, however, and due to its emergency
nature which often makes it &quot;must pass&quot; legislation, supplemental
spending allows lawmakers to get around budgetary enforcement rules and to
deliberately underfund programs in regular appropriation legislation – a budget
gimmick sometimes used to make program funding look smaller than it really is. </p>

training, the military, healthcare, and entitlement programs like Social
Security and unemployment benefits. When revenues (money coming in) are higher
than expenditures (money going out), you have a surplus. Much more frequently,
however, is when expenditures exceed revenues. In this case you have a deficit.
