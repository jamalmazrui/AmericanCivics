writers have so confounded society with government, as to leave little or no
distinction between them; whereas they are not only different, but have
different origins. Society is produced by our wants and government by our
wickedness; the former promotes our happiness <i>positively</i> by uniting our
affections, the latter <i>negatively</i> by restraining our vices. The one
encourages intercourse, the other <span style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:

punisher.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Society in every state is a
blessing, but government, even in its best state, is but a necessary evil; in
its worst state an intolerable one: for when we suffer, or are exposed to the
same miseries <i>by a government,</i> which we might expect in a country <i>without
government,</i> our calamity is heightened by reflecting that <span
style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:107%'>10 </span>we furnish the means by
which we suffer. Government, like dress, is the badge of lost innocence; the
palaces of kings are built upon the ruins of the bowers of paradise. For were
the impulses of conscience clear, uniform and irresistibly obeyed, man would
need no other law-giver; but that not being the case, he finds it necessary to
surrender up a part of his property to furnish means for the <span

induced to do by the same prudence which in every other case advises him, out
of two evils to choose the least. Wherefore, security being the true design and
end of government, it unanswerably follows that whatever form thereof appears
most likely to ensure it to us, with the least <span style='font-size:9.0pt;
line-height:107%'>5 </span>expense and greatest benefit, is preferable to all
others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:18.5pt'>In order to gain a clear and just
idea of the design and end of government, let us suppose a small number of
persons settled in some sequestered part of the earth, unconnected with the
rest; they will then represent the first peopling of any country, or of the
world. In this state of natural liberty, society will be their </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.25pt;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:107%'>10 </span>first thought. A thousand
motives will excite them thereto; the strength of one man is so unequal to his
wants, and his mind so unfitted for perpetual solitude, that he is soon obliged
to seek assistance and relief of another, who in his turn requires the same.
Four or five united would be able to raise a tolerable dwelling in the midst of
a wilderness, but one man might labor out the common period </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:5.05pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'><span style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:107%'>15 </span>of
life without accomplishing any thing; when he had felled his timber he could
not remove it, nor erect it after it was removed; hunger in the mean time would
urge him to quit his work, and every different want would call him a different
way. Disease, nay even misfortune, would be death; for though neither might be
mortal, yet either would disable him from living, and reduce him to a state <span
style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:107%'>20 </span>in which he might rather be
said to perish than to die.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:18.5pt'>Thus necessity, like a
gravitating power, would soon form our newly arrived emigrants into society,
the reciprocal blessings of which would supercede, and render the obligations
of law and government unnecessary while they remained perfectly just to each
other; but as nothing but Heaven is impregnable to vice, it </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:4.55pt;

line-height:107%'>25 </span>will unavoidably happen that in proportion as they
surmount the first difficulties of emigration, which bound them together in a
common cause, they will begin to relax in their duty and attachment to each
other; and this remissness will point out the necessity of establishing some
form of government to supply the defect of moral virtue.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:4.65pt;
margin-left:17.25pt;text-indent:-.25in'><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
line-height:107%'>30 </span>Some convenient tree will afford them a State
House, under the branches of which the whole colony may assemble to deliberate
on public matters. It is more than probable that their first laws will have the
title only of regulations and be enforced by no other penalty than public
disesteem. In this first parliament every man by natural right will have a
seat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;
margin-left:17.25pt;text-indent:-.25in'><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
line-height:107%'>35 </span>But as the colony increases, the public concerns
will increase likewise, and the distance at which the members may be separated,
will render it too inconvenient for all of them to meet on every occasion as at
first, when their number was small, their habitations near, and the public
concerns few and trifling. This will point out the convenience of their
consenting to leave the legislative part to be managed by a select number
chosen from the whole body, who are supposed to have the same concerns at stake
which those have who appointed them, and who will act in the same manner as the
whole body would act were they present. If the colony continue increasing, it
will become necessary to augment the number of representatives, and that the
interest of every part of the colony may be attended to, it will be found best
to divide the whole into convenient parts, each part sending its proper number:
and that the <i>elected</i> might never form to themselves an interest separate
from the <i>electors,</i> prudence will point out the propriety of having
elections often: <span style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:107%'>10 </span>because
as the <i>elected</i> might by that means return and mix again with the general
body of the <i>electors</i> in a few months, their fidelity to the public will
be secured by the prudent reflection of not making a rod for themselves. And as
this frequent interchange will establish a common interest with every part of
the community, they will mutually and naturally support each other, and on <span
style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:107%'>15 </span>this, (not on the unmeaning
name of king,) depends the <i>strength of government, and the happiness of the
governed</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:5.75pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Here then is the origin and rise of government; namely, a
mode rendered necessary by the inability of moral virtue to govern the world;
here too is the design and end of government, viz. freedom and security. And
however our eyes <span style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:107%'>20 </span>may
be dazzled with show, or our ears deceived by sound; however prejudice may warp
our wills, or interest darken our understanding, the simple voice of nature and
reason will say, ’tis right.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:5.75pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>I draw my idea of the form of government from a principle
in nature which no art can overturn, viz. that the more simple any thing is,
the less liable it is to be <span style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:107%'>25 </span>disordered;
and the easier repaired when disordered; and with this maxim in view I offer a
few remarks on the so much boasted Constitution of England. That it was noble
for the dark and slavish times in which it was erected, is granted. When the
world was overrun with tyranny the least remove therefrom was a glorious
rescue. But that it is imperfect, subject to convulsions, and incapable <span
style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:107%'>30 </span>of producing what it seems
to promise, is easily demonstrated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Absolute governments, (though the
disgrace of human nature) have this advantage with them, they are simple; if
the people suffer, they know the head from which their suffering springs; know
likewise the remedy; and are not bewildered by a variety of causes and cures.
But the Constitution of England is <span style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:
107%'>35 </span>so exceedingly complex, that the nation may suffer for years
together without being able to discover in which part the fault lies; some will
say in one and some in another, and every political physician will advise a
different medicine.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:5.55pt;
margin-left:18.5pt'>I know it is difficult to get over local or long standing
prejudices, yet if we will suffer ourselves to examine the component parts of
the English Constitution, we shall find them to be the base remains of two
ancient tyrannies, compounded with some new Republican materials.</p>

king a power to check the Commons, by empowering him to reject their other

supposed to be wiser than him. A mere absurdity!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:18.5pt'>There is something exceedingly

state of a king shuts him from the world, yet the business of a king requires
him to know it thoroughly; wherefore the different parts, by unnaturally
opposing and destroying each other, prove the whole character to be absurd and
useless.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'><span style='font-size:9.0pt;

Constitution thus: the king, say they, is one, the people another; the peers
are a house in behalf of the king, the Commons in behalf of the people; but
this hath all the distinctions of a house divided against itself; and though

power, <i>which needs checking,</i> be from God; yet the provision which the

prejudice of Englishmen, in favor of their own government, by king, lords and
Commons, arises as much or more from national pride than reason. Individuals
are undoubtedly safer in England than in some other countries: but the will of
the king is as much the law of the land in Britain as in France, with this
difference, that instead of proceeding directly from his mouth, it is handed <span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>An inquiry into the <i>constitutional
errors</i> in the English form of government, is at this time highly necessary;
for as we are never in a proper condition of doing justice to others, while we
continue under the influence of some leading partiality, so neither are we
capable of doing it to ourselves while we remain <span style='font-size:9.0pt;
line-height:107%'>35 </span>fettered by any obstinate prejudice. And as a man
who is attached to a prostitute is unfitted to choose or judge of a wife, so
any prepossession in favor of a rotten constitution of government will disable
us from discerning a good one.</p>

account of the creation, till the Jews under a national delusion requested a

the Almighty interposed) was a kind of Republic, administered by a judge and
the elders of the tribes. Kings they had none, and it was held sinful to
acknowledge any being under that title but the Lord of Hosts. And when a man
seriously reflects on the idolatrous homage which is paid to the persons of
kings, he need not wonder that the Almighty, ever jealous of his honor, should
disapprove a form of government which so impiously invades the prerogative of
heaven....</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>To the evil of monarchy we have
added that of hereditary succession; and as the first is a degradation and
lessening of ourselves, so the second, claimed as a matter of right, is an
insult and imposition on posterity. For all men being originally equals, no one
by birth could have a right to set up his own family in perpetual preference to
all others for ever, and though himself might deserve <span style='font-size:
9.0pt;line-height:107%'>20 </span>some decent degree of honors of his
cotemporaries, yet his descendants might be far too unworthy to inherit them.
One of the strongest natural proofs of the folly of hereditary right in kings,
is that nature disapproves it, otherwise she would not so frequently turn it
into ridicule, by giving mankind an <i>ass for a lion</i>. Secondly, as no man
at first could possess any other public honors than were <span
style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:107%'>25 </span>bestowed upon him, so the
givers of those honors could have no power to give away the right of posterity,
and though they might say, “We choose you for our head,” they could not without
manifest injustice to their children say “that your children and your
children’s children shall reign over ours forever.” Because such an unwise,
unjust, unnatural compact might (perhaps) in the next succession <span
style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:107%'>30 </span>put them under the
government of a rogue or a fool. Most wise men in their private sentiments have
ever treated hereditary right with contempt; yet it is one of those evils which
when once established is not easily removed: many submit from fear, others from
superstition, and the more powerful part shares </p>

world to have had an honorable origin: whereas it is more than probable, that,

obtained him the title of chief among plunderers: and who by increasing in

his electors could have no idea of giving hereditary right to his descendants,
because such a perpetual exclusion of themselves was incompatible with the free

claim, but as something casual or complemental; but as few </p>

favor hereditary pretensions; by which means it happened, as it hath happened

claimed as a right.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:18.5pt'>Yet I should be glad to ask how
they suppose kings came at first? The question admits but of three answers,
viz. either by lot, by election, or by usurpation. If the first king was taken
by lot, it establishes a precedent for the next, which excludes </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.25pt;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:107%'>30 </span>hereditary succession. Saul
was by lot, yet the succession was not hereditary, neither does it appear from
that transaction that there was any intention it ever should. If the first king
of any country was by election, that likewise establishes a precedent for the
next; for to say, that the right of all future generations is taken away, by
the act of the first electors, in their choice not only of a king </p>

ever, hath no parallel in or out of scripture but the doctrine of original sin,
which supposes the free will of all men lost in Adam; and from such comparison,
and it will admit of no other, hereditary succession can derive no glory. For
as in Adam all sinned, and as in the first electors all men obeyed; as in the
one all mankind were subjected to Satan, and in the other </p>

first, and our authority in the last; and as both disable us from reassuming
some former state and privilege, it unanswerably follows that original sin and
hereditary succession are parallels. Dishonorable rank! Inglorious connection!

defend it; and that William the Conqueror was an usurper is a fact not to be
contradicted. The plain truth is, that the antiquity of English monarchy will
not bear looking into.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:5.75pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>But it is not so much the absurdity as the evil of
hereditary succession which concerns mankind. Did it insure a race of good and
wise men it would have the <span style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:107%'>10 </span>seal
of divine authority, but as it opens a door to the <i>foolish,</i> the <i>wicked,</i>
and the <i>improper,</i> it has in it the nature of oppression. Men who look
upon themselves born to reign, and others to obey, soon grow insolent. Selected
from the rest of mankind, their minds are early poisoned by importance; and the
world they act in differs so materially from the world at large, that they have
but little opportunity <span style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:107%'>15 </span>of
knowing its true interests, and when they succeed to the government are
frequently the most ignorant and unfit of any throughout the dominions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:5.8pt;

the throne is subject to be possessed by a minor at any age; all which time the
regency acting under the cover of a king have every opportunity and inducement
to betray their <span style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:107%'>20 </span>trust.
The same national misfortune happens when a king worn out with age and
infirmity enters the last stage of human weakness. In both these cases the
public becomes a prey to every miscreant who can tamper successfully with the
follies either of age or infancy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:5.75pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>The most plausible plea which hath ever been offered in
favor of hereditary <span style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:107%'>25 </span>succession
is, that it preserves a nation from civil wars; and were this true, it would be
weighty; whereas it is the most barefaced falsity ever imposed upon mankind.
The whole history of England disowns the fact. Thirty kings and two minors have
reigned in that distracted kingdom since the conquest, in which time there has
been (including the revolution) no less than eight civil wars and <span
style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:107%'>30 </span>nineteen rebellions.
Wherefore instead of making for peace, it makes against it, and destroys the
very foundation it seems to stand upon....</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>In short, monarchy and succession
have laid (not this or that kingdom only) but the world in blood and ashes.

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If we inquire into the business
of a king, we shall find that in some countries they may have none; and after
sauntering away their lives without pleasure to themselves or advantage to the
nation, withdraw from the scene, and leave their successors to tread the same
idle round. In absolute monarchies, the whole weight of business civil and
military lies on the king; the children of Israel in their request for a king
urged this plea, “that he may judge us, and go out before </p>

is neither a judge nor a general, as in England, a man would be puzzled to know
what <i>is</i> his business.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:18.5pt'>The nearer any government
approaches to a Republic, the less business there is for a king. It is somewhat
difficult to find a proper name for the government of England. Sir William
Meredith calls it a Republic; but in its present state </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.25pt;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:107%'>10 </span>it is unworthy of the name,
because the corrupt influence of the crown, by having all the places in its
disposal, hath so effectually swallowed up the power, and eaten out the virtue
of the House of Commons (the republican part in the Constitution) that the
government of England is nearly as monarchical as that of France or Spain. Men
fall out with names without understanding </p>

For ’tis the republican and not the monarchical part of the Constitution of
England which Englishmen glory in, viz. the liberty of choosing an House of
Commons from out of their own body—and it is easy to see that when republican
virtues fail, slavery ensues. Why is the Constitution of England sickly, but
because monarchy hath poisoned the Republic; the crown has engrossed <span
style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:107%'>20 </span>the Commons.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:18.5pt'>In England a king hath little
more to do than to make war and give away places; which, in plain terms, is to
impoverish the nation and set it together by the ears. A pretty business indeed
for a man to be allowed eight hundred thousand sterling a year for, and
worshipped into the bargain! Of more worth </p>
