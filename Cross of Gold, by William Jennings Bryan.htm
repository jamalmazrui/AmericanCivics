<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:14.05pt;
margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:normal'><i>The most famous speech in American
political history was delivered by William Jennings Bryan on July 9, 1896, at
the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. The issue was whether to endorse
the free coinage of silver at a ratio of silver to gold of 16 to 1. (This
inflationary measure would have increased the amount of money in circulation
and aided cash-poor and debt-burdened farmers.) After speeches on the subject
by several U.S. Senators, Bryan rose to speak. The thirty-six-year-old former
Congressman from Nebraska aspired to be the Democratic nominee for president,
and he had been skillfully, but quietly, building support for himself among the
delegates. His dramatic speaking style and rhetoric roused the crowd to a
frenzy. The response, wrote one reporter, “came like one great burst of
artillery.” Men and women screamed and waved their hats and canes. “Some,”
wrote another reporter, “like demented things, divested themselves of their
coats and flung them high in the air.” The next day the convention nominated
Bryan for President on the fifth ballot. The full text of William Jenning
Bryan’s famous “Cross of Gold” speech appears below. The audio portion is an
excerpt. [Note on the recording: In 1896 recording technology was in its
infancy, and recording a political convention would have been impossible. But
in the early 20th century, the fame of Bryan’s “Cross of Gold” speech led him
to repeat it numerous times on the Chautauqua lecture circuit where he was an
enormously popular speaker. In 1921 (25 years after the original speech), he
recorded portions of the speech for Gennett Records in Richmond, Indiana.
Although the recording does not capture the power and drama of the original
address, it does allow us to hear Bryan delivering this famous speech.]  </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Transcript: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I would be presumptuous, indeed,
to present myself against the distinguished gentlemen to whom you have listened
if this were but a measuring of ability; but this is not a contest among
persons. The humblest citizen in all the land when clad in the armor of a
righteous cause is stronger than all the whole hosts of error that they can
bring. I come to speak to you in defense of a cause as holy as the cause of
liberty—the cause of humanity. When this debate is concluded, a motion will be
made to lay upon the table the resolution offered in commendation of the
administration and also the resolution in condemnation of the administration. I
shall object to bringing this question down to a level of persons. The
individual is but an atom; he is born, he acts, he dies; but principles are
eternal; and this has been a contest of principle. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Never before in the history of
this country has there been witnessed such a contest as that through which we
have passed. Never before in the history of American politics has a great issue
been fought out as this issue has been by the voters themselves. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>On the 4th of March, 1895, a few
Democrats, most of them members of Congress, issued an address to the Democrats
of the nation asserting that the money question was the paramount issue of the
hour; asserting also the right of a majority of the Democratic Party to control
the position of the party on this paramount issue; concluding with the request
that all believers in free coinage of silver in the Democratic Party should
organize and take charge of and control the policy of the Democratic Party.
Three months later, at Memphis, an organization was perfected, and the silver
Democrats went forth openly and boldly and courageously proclaiming their
belief and declaring that if successful they would crystallize in a platform
the declaration which they had made; and then began the conflict with a zeal
approaching the zeal which inspired the crusaders who followed Peter the
Hermit. Our silver Democrats went forth from victory unto victory, until they
are assembled now, not to discuss, not to debate, but to enter up the judgment
rendered by the plain people of this country. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>But in this contest, brother has
been arrayed against brother, and father against son. The warmest ties of love
and acquaintance and association have been disregarded. Old leaders have been
cast aside when they refused to give expression to the sentiments of those whom
they would lead, and new leaders have sprung up to give direction to this cause
of freedom. Thus has the contest been waged, and we have assembled here under
as binding and solemn instructions as were ever fastened upon the
representatives of a people. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>We do not come as individuals.
Why, as individuals we might have been glad to compliment the gentleman from
New York [Senator Hill], but we knew that the people for whom we speak would
never be willing to put him in a position where he could thwart the will of the
Democratic Party. I say it was not a question of persons; it was a question of
principle; and it is not with gladness, my friends, that we find ourselves
brought into conflict with those who are now arrayed on the other side. The
gentleman who just preceded me [Governor Russell] spoke of the old state of
Massachusetts. Let me assure him that not one person in all this convention
entertains the least hostility to the people of the state of Massachusetts. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>But we stand here representing
people who are the equals before the law of the largest cities in the state of
Massachusetts. When you come before us and tell us that we shall disturb your
business interests, we reply that you have disturbed our business interests by
your action. We say to you that you have made too limited in its application
the definition of a businessman. The man who is employed for wages is as much a
businessman as his employer. The attorney in a country town is as much a
businessman as the corporation counsel in a great metropolis. The merchant at
the crossroads store is as much a businessman as the merchant of New York. The
farmer who goes forth in the morning and toils all day, begins in the spring
and toils all summer, and by the application of brain and muscle to the natural
resources of this country creates wealth, is as much a businessman as the man
who goes upon the Board of Trade and bets upon the price of grain. The miners
who go 1,000 feet into the earth or climb 2,000 feet upon the cliffs and bring
forth from their hiding places the precious metals to be poured in the channels
of trade are as much businessmen as the few financial magnates who in a
backroom corner the money of the world. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>We come to speak for this broader
class of businessmen. Ah. my friends, we say not one word against those who
live upon the Atlantic Coast; but those hardy pioneers who braved all the
dangers of the wilderness, who have made the desert to blossom as the
rose—those pioneers away out there, rearing their children near to nature’s
heart, where they can mingle their voices with the voices of the birds—out
there where they have erected schoolhouses for the education of their children
and churches where they praise their Creator, and the cemeteries where sleep
the ashes of their dead—are as deserving of the consideration of this party as
any people in this country. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>It is for these that we speak. We
do not come as aggressors. Our war is not a war of conquest. We are fighting in
the defense of our homes, our families, and posterity. We have petitioned, and
our petitions have been scorned. We have entreated, and our entreaties have
been disregarded. We have begged, and they have mocked when our calamity came. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>We beg no longer; we entreat no
more; we petition no more. We defy them! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The gentleman from Wisconsin has
said he fears a Robespierre. My friend, in this land of the free you need fear
no tyrant who will spring up from among the people. What we need is an Andrew
Jackson to stand as Jackson stood, against the encroachments of aggregated
wealth. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>They tell us that this platform
was made to catch votes. We reply to them that changing conditions make new
issues; that the principles upon which rest Democracy are as everlasting as the
hills; but that they must be applied to new conditions as they arise.
Conditions have arisen and we are attempting to meet those conditions. They
tell us that the income tax ought not to be brought in here; that is not a new
idea. They criticize us for our criticism of the Supreme Court of the United
States. My friends, we have made no criticism. We have simply called attention
to what you know. If you want criticisms, read the dissenting opinions of the
Court. That will give you criticisms. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>They say we passed an
unconstitutional law. I deny it. The income tax was not unconstitutional when
it was passed. It was not unconstitutional when it went before the Supreme Court
for the first time. It did not become unconstitutional until one judge changed
his mind; and we cannot be expected to know when a judge will change his mind. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The income tax is a just law. It
simply intends to put the burdens of government justly upon the backs of the
people. I am in favor of an income tax. When I find a man who is not willing to
pay his share of the burden of the government which protects him, I find a man
who is unworthy to enjoy the blessings of a government like ours. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>He says that we are opposing the
national bank currency. It is true. If you will read what Thomas Benton said,
you will find that he said that in searching history he could find but one
parallel to Andrew Jackson. That was Cicero, who destroyed the conspiracies of
Cataline and saved Rome. He did for Rome what Jackson did when he destroyed the
bank conspiracy and saved America. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>We say in our platform that we
believe that the right to coin money and issue money is a function of
government. We believe it. We believe it is a part of sovereignty and can no
more with safety be delegated to private individuals than can the power to make
penal statutes or levy laws for taxation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Mr. Jefferson, who was once
regarded as good Democratic authority, seems to have a different opinion from
the gentleman who has addressed us on the part of the minority. Those who are
opposed to this proposition tell us that the issue of paper money is a function
of the bank and that the government ought to go out of the banking business. I
stand with Jefferson rather than with them, and tell them, as he did, that the
issue of money is a function of the government and that the banks should go out
of the governing business. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>They complain about the plank
which declares against the life tenure in office. They have tried to strain it
to mean that which it does not mean. What we oppose in that plank is the life
tenure that is being built up in Washington which establishes an officeholding
class and excludes from participation in the benefits the humbler members of
our society. . . . </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Let me call attention to two or
three great things. The gentleman from New York says that he will propose an
amendment providing that this change in our law shall not affect contracts
which, according to the present laws, are made payable in gold. But if he means
to say that we cannot change our monetary system without protecting those who
have loaned money before the change was made, I want to ask him where, in law
or in morals, he can find authority for not protecting the debtors when the act
of 1873 was passed when he now insists that we must protect the creditor. He
says he also wants to amend this platform so as to provide that if we fail to
maintain the parity within a year that we will then suspend the coinage of
silver. We reply that when we advocate a thing which we believe will be
successful we are not compelled to raise a doubt as to our own sincerity by
trying to show what we will do if we are wrong. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I ask him, if he will apply his
logic to us, why he does not apply it to himself. He says that he wants this
country to try to secure an international agreement. Why doesn’t he tell us
what he is going to do if they fail to secure an international agreement. There
is more reason for him to do that than for us to expect to fail to maintain the
parity. They have tried for thirty years—thirty years—to secure an
international agreement, and those are waiting for it most patiently who don’t
want it at all. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Now, my friends, let me come to
the great paramount issue. If they ask us here why it is we say more on the
money question than we say upon the tariff question, I reply that if protection
has slain its thousands the gold standard has slain its tens of thousands. If
they ask us why we did not embody all these things in our platform which we
believe, we reply to them that when we have restored the money of the
Constitution, all other necessary reforms will be possible, and that until that
is done there is no reform that can be accomplished. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Why is it that within three
months such a change has come over the sentiments of the country? Three months
ago, when it was confidently asserted that those who believed in the gold
standard would frame our platforms and nominate our candidates, even the
advocates of the gold standard did not think that we could elect a President;
but they had good reasons for the suspicion, because there is scarcely a state
here today asking for the gold standard that is not within the absolute control
of the Republican Party. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>But note the change. Mr. McKinley
was nominated at St. Louis upon a platform that declared for the maintenance of
the gold standard until it should be changed into bimetallism by an
international agreement. Mr. McKinley was the most popular man among the
Republicans ; and everybody three months ago in the Republican Party prophesied
his election. How is it today? Why, that man who used to boast that he looked
like Napoleon, that man shudders today when he thinks that he was nominated on
the anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo. Not only that, but as he listens he
can hear with ever increasing distinctness the sound of the waves as they beat
upon the lonely shores of St. Helena. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Why this change? Ah, my friends.
is not the change evident to anyone who will look at the matter? It is because
no private character, however pure, no personal popularity, however great, can
protect from the avenging wrath of an indignant people the man who will either
declare that he is in favor of fastening the gold standard upon this people, or
who is willing to surrender the right of self-government and place legislative
control in the hands of foreign potentates and powers. . . . </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>We go forth confident that we
shall win. Why? Because upon the paramount issue in this campaign there is not
a spot of ground upon which the enemy will dare to challenge battle. Why, if
they tell us that the gold standard is a good thing, we point to their platform
and tell them that their platform pledges the party to get rid of a gold
standard and substitute bimetallism. If the gold standard is a good thing, why
try to get rid of it? If the gold standard, and I might call your attention to
the fact that some of the very people who are in this convention today and who
tell you that we ought to declare in favor of international bimetallism and
thereby declare that the gold standard is wrong and that the principles of
bimetallism are better—these very people four months ago were open and avowed
advocates of the gold standard and telling us that we could not legislate two
metals together even with all the world. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I want to suggest this truth,
that if the gold standard is a good thing we ought to declare in favor of its
retention and not in favor of abandoning it; and if the gold standard is a bad
thing, why should we wait until some other nations are willing to help us to
let it go? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Here is the line of battle. We
care not upon which issue they force the fight. We are prepared to meet them on
either issue or on both. If they tell us that the gold standard is the standard
of civilization, we reply to them that this, the most enlightened of all
nations of the earth, has never declared for a gold standard, and both the
parties this year are declaring against it. If the gold standard is the
standard of civilization, why, my friends, should we not have it? So if they
come to meet us on that, we can present the history of our nation. More than
that, we can tell them this, that they will search the pages of history in vain
to find a single instance in which the common people of any land ever declared
themselves in favor of a gold standard. They can find where the holders of
fixed investments have. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Mr. Carlisle said in 1878 that
this was a struggle between the idle holders of idle capital and the struggling
masses who produce the wealth and pay the taxes of the country; and my friends,
it is simply a question that we shall decide upon which side shall the
Democratic Party fight. Upon the side of the idle holders of idle capital, or upon
the side of the struggling masses? That is the question that the party must
answer first; and then it must be answered by each individual hereafter. The
sympathies of the Democratic Party, as described by the platform, are on the
side of the struggling masses, who have ever been the foundation of the
Democratic Party. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>There are two ideas of
government. There are those who believe that if you just legislate to make the
well-to-do prosperous, that their prosperity will leak through on those below.
The Democratic idea has been that if you legislate to make the masses
prosperous their prosperity will find its way up and through every class that
rests upon it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>You come to us and tell us that
the great cities are in favor of the gold standard. I tell you that the great
cities rest upon these broad and fertile prairies. Burn down your cities and
leave our farms, and your cities will spring up again as if by magic. But
destroy our farms and the grass will grow in the streets of every city in the
country.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>My friends, we shall declare that
this nation is able to legislate for its own people on every question without
waiting for the aid or consent of any other nation on earth, and upon that
issue we expect to carry every single state in the Union. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I shall not slander the fair
state of Massachusetts nor the state of New York by saying that when citizens
are confronted with the proposition, “Is this nation able to attend to its own
business?”—I will not slander either one by saying that the people of those
states will declare our helpless impotency as a nation to attend to our own
business. It is the issue of 1776 over again. Our ancestors, when but 3
million, had the courage to declare their political independence of every other
nation upon earth. Shall we, their descendants, when we have grown to 70
million, declare that we are less independent than our forefathers? No, my
friends, it will never be the judgment of this people. Therefore, we care not
upon what lines the battle is fought. If they say bimetallism is good but we
cannot have it till some nation helps us, we reply that, instead of having a
gold standard because England has, we shall restore bimetallism, and then let
England have bimetallism because the United States have. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If they dare to come out in the
open field and defend the gold standard as a good thing, we shall fight them to
the uttermost, having behind us the producing masses of the nation and the
world. Having behind us the commercial interests and the laboring interests and
all the toiling masses, we shall answer their demands for a gold standard by
saying to them, you shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of
thorns. You shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold. </p>
