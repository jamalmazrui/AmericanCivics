D. Eisenhower, Farewell Address, 1961</span></i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-bottom:13.15pt;text-align:left;
text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:.7pt;text-indent:0in;line-height:105%'><i>As
Supreme Commander of Allied forces during World War II, Dwight D. Eisenhower
had won wide admiration for forging an effective fighting force out of a huge
agglomeration of disparate armies and military leaders. As President,
Eisenhower’s conservative managerial style emphasized national unity in the
face of conflict. His conservatism also caused him to worry over the rapid
growth of the arms race and the “military-industrial complex.”</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-bottom:15.4pt;text-align:left;

style='font-size:7.0pt;line-height:107%'>Papers of the Presidents: Dwight D.
Eisenhower (1960–1961).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.7pt;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:-.75pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:0in'>Three days from now,
after half a century in the service of our country, I shall lay down the
responsibilities of office as, in traditional and solemn ceremony, the
authority of the Presidency is vested in my successor….</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.7pt;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:-.75pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>We now stand ten years past the midpoint
of a century that has witnessed four major wars among great nations. Three of
them involved our own country. Despite these holocausts America is today the
strongest, the most influential and most productive nation in the world.
Understandably proud of this pre-eminence we yet realize that America’s
leadership and prestige depend, not merely upon our unmatched material
progress, riches and military strength, but on how we use our power in the
interests of world peace and human betterment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.7pt;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:-.75pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Throughout America’s adventure in
free government, our basic purposes have been to keep the peace; to foster
progress in human achievement, and to enhance liberty, dignity and integrity
among people and among nations. To strive for less would be unworthy of a free
and religious people. Any failure traceable to arrogance, or our lack of
comprehension or readiness to sacrifice would inflict upon us grievous hurt
both at home and abroad.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.7pt;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:-.75pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Progress toward these noble goals is
persistently threatened by the conflict now engulfing the world. It commands
our whole attention, absorbs our very beings. We face a hostile ideology—
global in scope, atheistic in character, ruthless in purpose, and insidious in
method.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.7pt;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:-.75pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Unhappily the danger it poses
promises to be of indefinite duration. To meet it successfully, there is called
for, not so much the emotional and transitory sacrifices of crisis, but rather
those which enable us to carry forward steadily, surely, and without complaint
the burdens of a prolonged and complex struggle—with liberty the stake. Only
thus shall we remain, despite every provocation, on our charted course toward
permanent peace and human betterment….</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.7pt;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:-.75pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>A vital element in keeping the peace
is our military establishment. Our arms must be mighty, ready for instant
action, so that no potential aggressor may be tempted to risk his own
destruction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.7pt;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:-.75pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Our military organization today bears
little relation to that known by any of my predecessors in peacetime, or indeed
by the fighting men of World War II or Korea.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.7pt;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:-.75pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Until the latest of our world
conflicts, the United States had no armaments industry. American makers of
plowshares could, with time and as required, make swords as well. But now we
can no longer risk emergency improvisation of national defense; we have been
compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions. Added
to this, three and a half million men and women are directly engaged in the
defense establishment. We annually spend on military security more than the net
income of all United States corporations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.7pt;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:-.75pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>This conjunction of an immense
military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American
experience. The total influence—economic, political, even spiritual—is felt in
every city, every statehouse, every office of the federal government. We
recognize the imperative need for this development. Yet we must not fail to
comprehend its grave implications. Our toil, resources, and livelihood are all
involved; so is the very structure of our society.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.7pt;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:-.75pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>In the councils of government, we
must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or
unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous
rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.7pt;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:-.75pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>We must never let the weight of this
combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should take
nothing for granted. Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the
proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with
our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper
together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.7pt;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:-.75pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Akin to, and largely responsible for
the sweeping changes in our industrial-military posture, has been the
technological revolution during recent decades.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.7pt;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:-.75pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>In this revolution, research has
become central; it also becomes more formalized, complex, and costly. A
steadily increasing share is conducted for, by, or at the direction of, the
federal government….</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.7pt;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:-.75pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>The prospect of domination of the
nation’s scholars by federal employment, project allocations, and the power of
money is ever present—and is gravely to be regarded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.7pt;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:-.75pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Yet, in holding scientific research
and discovery in respect, as we should, we must also be alert to the equal and
opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a
scientific-technological elite.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.7pt;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:-.75pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>It is the task of statesmanship to
mold, to balance, and to integrate these and other forces, new and old, within
the principles of our democratic system—ever aiming toward the supreme goals of
our free society.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.7pt;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:-.75pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Another factor in maintaining balance
involves the element of time. As we peer into society’s future, we—you and I,
and our government—must avoid the impulse to live only for today, plundering,
for our own ease and convenience, the precious resources of tomorrow. We cannot
mortgage the material assets of our grandchildren without risking the loss also
of their political and spiritual heritage. We want democracy to survive for all
generations to come, not to become the insolvent phantom of tomorrow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.7pt;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:-.75pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Down the long lane of the history yet
to be written America knows that this world of ours, ever growing smaller, must
avoid becoming a community of dreadful fear and hate, and be, instead, a proud
confederation of mutual trust and respect.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.7pt;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:-.75pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Such a confederation must be one of
equals. The weakest must come to the conference table with the same confidence
as do we, protected as we are by our moral, economic, and military strength.
That table, though scarred by many past frustrations, cannot be abandoned for
the certain agony of the battlefield.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.7pt;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:-.75pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Disarmament, with mutual honor and
confidence, is a continuing imperative. Together we must learn how to compose
differences, not with arms, but with intellect and decent purpose. Because this
need is so sharp and apparent I confess that I lay down my official
responsibilities in this field with a definite sense of disappointment. As one
who has witnessed the horror and the lingering sadness of war—as one who knows
that another war could utterly destroy this civilization which has been so
slowly and painfully built over thousands of years—I wish I could say tonight
that a lasting peace is in sight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.7pt;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:-.75pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Happily, I can say that war has been
avoided. Steady progress toward our ultimate goal has been made. But, so much
remains to be done. As a private citizen, I shall never cease to do what little
I can to help the world advance along that road….</p>
