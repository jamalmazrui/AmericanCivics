of <i>Wilsonian Idealism</i>, expresses American foreign policy goals in
universal and ideal terms rather than in the language of direct national
interests.  In proposing a “Lend-Lease” program to aid the British in their war
against Germany, FDR echoes Wilson’s commitment to democracy abroad couched in
international principles derived from traditional American values, New Deal
socioeconomic policies, and American opposition to the aggression and
militarism of “dictator nations.” ] </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>I address you, the Members of the
77th Congress, at a moment unprecedented in the history of the Union. I use the
word “unprecedented,” because at no previous time has American security been as
seriously threatened from without as it is today. . . . </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>It is true that prior to 1914 the
United States often had been disturbed by events in other Continents. We had
even engaged in two wars with European nations and in a number of undeclared
wars in the West Indies, in the Mediterranean and in the Pacific for the maintenance
of American rights and for the principles of peaceful commerce. In no case,
however, had a serious threat been raised against our national safety or our
independence. </p>

<br clear=ALL>
What I seek to convey is the historic truth that the United States as a nation
has at all times maintained opposition to any attempt to lock us in behind an
ancient Chinese wall while the procession of civilization went past. Today,
thinking of our children and their children, we oppose enforced isolation for
ourselves or for any part of the Americas. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>Even when the World War broke out
in 1914, it seemed to contain only small threat of danger to our own American
future. But, as time went on, the American people began to visualize what the
downfall of democratic nations might mean to our own democracy. We need not
over-emphasize imperfections in the Peace of Versailles. We need not harp on
failure of the democracies to deal with problems of world reconstruction. We
should remember that the Peace of 1919 was far less unjust than the kind of
“pacification” which began even before Munich, and which is being carried on
under the new order of tyranny that seeks to spread over every continent today.
The American people have unalterably set their faces against that tyranny. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>Every realist knows that the
democratic way of life is at this moment being directly assailed in every part
of the world—assailed either by arms, or by secret spreading of poisonous
propaganda by those who seek to destroy unity and promote discord in nations
still at peace. During sixteen months this assault has blotted out the whole
pattern of democratic life in an appalling number of independent nations, great
and small. The assailants are still on the march, threatening other nations,
great and small. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>Therefore, as your President,
performing my constitutional duty to “give to the Congress information of the
state of the Union,” I find it necessary to report that the future and the
safety of our country and of our democracy are overwhelmingly involved in
events far beyond our borders. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=right style='margin-right:7.6pt;text-align:right;
text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>Armed defense of democratic existence is now
being gallantly waged in four continents. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>If that defense
fails, all the population and all the resources of Europe, Asia, Africa and
Australasia will be dominated by the conquerors. The total of those populations
and their resources greatly exceeds the sum total of the population and
resources of the whole of the Western Hemisphere—many times over. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>In times like these it is
immature—and incidentally untrue—for anybody to brag that an unprepared America,
single-handed, and with one hand tied behind its back, can hold off the whole
world. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>No realistic American can expect
from a dictator’s peace international generosity, or return of true
independence, or world disarmament, or freedom of expression, or freedom of
religion—or even good business. Such a peace would bring no security for us or
for our neighbors. “Those, who would give up essential liberty to purchase a
little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety.” As a nation we
may take pride in the fact that we are softhearted; but we cannot afford to be
soft-hearted. We must always be wary of those who with sounding brass and a
tinkling cymbal preach the “ism” of appeasement. We must especially beware of
that small group of selfish men who would clip the wings of the American eagle
in order to feather their own nests. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>I have recently pointed out how
quickly the tempo of modern warfare could bring into our very midst the
physical attack which we must expect if the dictator nations win this war.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>There is much loose talk of our
immunity from immediate and direct invasion from across the seas. Obviously, as
long as the British Navy retains its power, no such danger exists. Even if
there were no British Navy, it is not probable that any enemy would be stupid
enough to attack us by landing troops in the United States from across
thousands of miles of ocean, until it had acquired strategic bases from which
to operate. But we learn much from the lessons of the past years in
Europe—particularly the lesson of Norway, whose essential seaports were
captured by treachery and surprise built up over a series of years. The first
phase of the invasion of this Hemisphere would not be the landing of regular
troops. The necessary strategic points would be occupied by secret agents and
their dupes—and great numbers of them are already here, and in Latin America. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>As long as the aggressor nations
maintain the offensive, they—not we—will choose the time and the place and the
method of their attack. That is why the future of all American Republics is
today in serious danger. That is why this Annual Message to the Congress is
unique in our history. That is why every member of the Executive branch of the
government and every member of the Congress face great responsibility—and great
accountability. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>The need of the moment is that
our actions and our policy should be devoted primarily— almost exclusively—to
meeting this foreign peril. For all our domestic problems are now a part of the
great emergency. Just as our national policy in internal affairs has been based
upon a decent respect for the rights and dignity of all our fellowmen within
our gates, so our national policy in foreign affairs has been based on a decent
respect for the rights and dignity of all nations, large and small. And the
justice of morality must and will win in the end. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:0in'>Our national policy
is this. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>First, by an impressive
expression of the public will and without regard to partisanship, we are
committed to all-inclusive national defense. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>Second, by an impressive
expression of the public will and without regard to partisanship, we are
committed to full support of all those resolute peoples, everywhere, who are
resisting aggression and are thereby keeping war away from our Hemisphere. By
this support, we express our determination that the democratic cause shall
prevail; and we strengthen the defense and security of our own nation.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>Third, by an impressive
expression of the public will and without regard to partisanship we are
committed to the proposition that principles of morality and considerations for
our own security will never permit us to acquiesce in a peace dictated by
aggressors and sponsored by appeasers. We know that enduring peace cannot be
bought at the cost of other people’s freedom. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>In the recent national election
there was no substantial difference between the two great parties in respect to
that national policy. No issue was fought out on this line before the American
electorate. Today, it is abundantly evident that American citizens everywhere
are demanding and supporting speedy and complete action in recognition of
obvious danger. Therefore, the immediate need is a swift and driving increase
in our armament production. . . . </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>Our most useful and immediate
role is to act as an arsenal for them as well as for ourselves. They do not
need man power. They do need billions of dollars worth of the weapons of
defense. . . . </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>Let us say to the democracies:
“We Americans are vitally concerned in your defense of freedom. We are putting
forth our energies, our resources and our organizing powers to give you the
strength to regain and maintain a free world. We shall send you, in
ever-increasing numbers, ships, planes, tanks, guns. This is our purpose and
our pledge.” In fulfillment of this purpose we will not be intimidated by the
threats of dictators that they will regard as a breach of international law and
as an act of war our aid to the democracies which dare to resist their
aggression. Such aid is not an act of war, even if a dictator should
unilaterally proclaim it so to be. When the dictators are ready to make war
upon us, they will not wait for an act of war on our part. They did not wait
for Norway or Belgium or the Netherlands to commit an act of war. Their only
interest is in a new one-way inter-national law, which lacks mutuality in its
observance, and, therefore, becomes an instrument of oppression. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>The happiness of future
generations of Americans may well depend upon how effective and how immediate
we can make our aid felt. No one can tell the exact character of the emergency
situations that we may be called upon to meet. The Nation’s hands must not be
tied when the Nation’s life is in danger. We must all prepare to make the
sacrifices that the emergency—as serious as war itself— demands. Whatever
stands in the way of speed and efficiency in defense preparations must give way
to the national need. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>A free nation has the right to
expect full cooperation from all groups. A free nation has the right to look to
the leaders of business, of labor, and of agriculture to take the lead in
stimulating effort, not among other groups but within their own groups. The
best way of dealing with the few slackers or trouble makers in our midst is,
first, to shame them by patriotic example, and, if that fails, to use the
sovereignty of government to save government. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>As men do not live by bread
alone, they do not fight by armaments alone. Those who man our defenses, and
those behind them who build our defenses, must have the stamina and courage
which come from an unshakable belief in the manner of life which they are
defending. The mighty action which we are calling for cannot be based on a
disregard of all things worth fighting for. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>The Nation takes great
satisfaction and much strength from the things which have been done to make its
people conscious of their individual stake in the preservation of democratic
life in America. Those things have toughened the fiber of our people, have
renewed their faith and strengthened their devotion to the institutions we make
ready to protect. Certainly this is no time to stop thinking about the social and
economic problems which are the root cause of the social revolution which is
today a supreme factor in the world. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>There is nothing mysterious about
the foundations of a healthy and strong democracy. The basic things expected by
our people of their political and economic systems are simple. They are:
equality of opportunity for youth and for others; jobs for those who can work;
security for those who need it; the ending of special privilege for the few;
the preservation of civil liberties for all; the enjoyment of the fruits of
scientific progress in a wider and constantly rising standard of living. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>These are the simple and basic
things that must never be lost sight of in the turmoil and unbelievable
complexity of our modern world. The inner and abiding strength of our economic
and political systems is dependent upon the degree to which they fulfill these
expectations. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>Many subjects connected with our
social economy call for immediate improvement. As examples: We should bring
more citizens under the coverage of old age pensions and unemployment
insurance. We should widen the opportunities for adequate medical care. We
should plan a better system by which persons deserving or needing gainful
employment may obtain it. I have called for personal sacrifice. I am assured of
the willingness of almost all Americans to respond to that call. . . . </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>In the future days, which we seek
to make secure, we look forward to a world founded upon four essential human
freedoms. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:0in'>The first is
freedom of speech and expression—everywhere in the world. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>The second is
freedom of every person to worship God in his own way—everywhere in the world. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>The third is freedom from
want—which, translated into world terms, means economic understandings which
will secure to every nation a healthy peace time life for its inhabitants—
everywhere in the world.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>The fourth is freedom from
fear—which, translated into world terms, means a worldwide reduction of
armaments to such a point and in such a thorough fashion that no nation will be
in a position to commit an act of physical aggression against any
neighbor—anywhere in the world. That is no vision of a distant millennium. It
is a definite basis for a kind of world attainable in our own time and
generation. That kind of world is the very antithesis of the so-called new
order of tyranny which the dictators seek to create with the crash of a bomb. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:7.05pt;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:-.75pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>To that new order we oppose the
greater conception—the moral order. A good society is able to face schemes of
world domination and foreign revolutions alike without fear. Since the
beginning of our American history we have been engaged in change—in a perpetual
peaceful revolution—a revolution which goes on steadily, quietly adjusting
itself to changing conditions—without the concentration camp or the quick-lime
in the ditch. The world order which we seek is the cooperation of free
countries, working together in a friendly, civilized society. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt'>This nation has placed its
destiny in the hands and heads and hearts of its millions of free men and
women; and its faith in freedom under the guidance of God. Freedom means the
supremacy of human rights everywhere. Our support goes to those who struggle to
gain those rights or keep them. Our strength is in our unity of purpose. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:0in'>To that high
concept there can be no end save victory.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'> </p>
