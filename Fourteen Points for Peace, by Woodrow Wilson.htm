<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>It will be our wish and purpose
that the processes of peace, when they are begun, shall be absolutely open and
that they shall involve and permit henceforth no secret understandings of any
kind. The day of conquest and aggrandizement is gone by; so is also the day of
secret covenants entered into in the interest of particular governments and
likely at some unlooked-for moment to upset the peace of the world. It is this
happy fact, now clear to the view of every public man whose thoughts do not
still linger in an age that is dead and gone, which makes it possible for every
nation whose purposes are consistent with justice and the peace of the world to
avow now or at any other time the objects it has in view. </p>

violations of right had occurred which touched us to the quick and made the
life of our own people impossible unless they were corrected and the world
secured once for all against their recurrence. What we demand in this war,
therefore, is nothing peculiar to ourselves. It is that the world be made fit
and safe to live in; and particularly that it be made safe for every
peace-loving nation which, like our own, wishes to live its own life, determine
its own institutions, be assured of justice and fair dealing by the other peoples
of the world as against force and selfish aggression. All the peoples of the
world are in effect partners in this interest, and for our own part we see very
clearly that unless justice be done to others it will not be done to us. The
program of the world's peace, therefore, is our program; and that program, the
only possible program, as we see it, is this: </p>

stable peace such as can be secured only by removing the chief provocations to
war, which this program does not remove. We have no jealousy of German
greatness, and there is nothing in this program that impairs it. We grudge her
no achievement or distinction of learning or of pacific enterprise such as have
made her record very bright and very enviable. We do not wish to injure her or
to block in any way her legitimate influence or power. We do not wish to fight
her either with arms or with hostile arrangements of trade if she is willing to
associate herself with us and the other peace-loving nations of the world in
covenants of justice and law and fair dealing. We wish her only to accept a
place of equality among the peoples of the world, -- the new world in which we
now live, -- instead of a place of mastery. </p>

to her any alteration or modification of her institutions. But it is necessary,
we must frankly say, and necessary as a preliminary to any intelligent dealings
with her on our part, that we should know whom her spokesmen speak for when
they speak to us, whether for the Reichstag majority or for the military party
and the men whose creed is imperial domination. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>We have spoken now, surely, in
terms too concrete to admit of any further doubt or question. An evident
principle runs through the whole program I have outlined. It is the principle
of justice to all peoples and nationalities, and their right to live on equal
terms of liberty and safety with one another, whether they be strong or weak.
Unless this principle be made its foundation no part of the structure of
international justice can stand. The people of the United States could act upon
no other principle; and to the vindication of this principle they are ready to
devote their lives, their honor, and everything that they possess. The moral
climax of this the culminating and final war for human liberty has come, and they
are ready to put their own strength, their own highest purpose, their own
integrity and devotion to the test. </p>
