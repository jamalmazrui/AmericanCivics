**Welcome To The World of Free Plain Vanilla Electronic Texts**<br />
<br />
**Etexts Readable By Both Humans and By Computers, Since 1971**<br />
<br />
*These Etexts Prepared By Hundreds of Volunteers and Donations*<br />
<br />
The Project Gutenberg Etext of Give Me Liberty Or Give Me Death<br />
<br />
******This file should be named 6-h.htm or 6-h.zip*****<br />
<br />
December, 1975  [Etext #6]<br />
[Date last updated: May 5, 2005]<br />
<br />
Officially released in December 1975, unofficially released for<br />
the 200th anniversary of the speech by Patrick Henry before the<br />
&quot;House&quot; as he referred to it. [Which was the Virgina Provincial<br />
Convention, March 23, 1775]<br />
<br />
We apologize for the fact that the legal small print is longer,<br />
and more complicated, than the Etext itself; our legal beagles,<br />
of whom there are now a half dozen or so, insist this must be a<br />
part of any Project Gutenberg Etext we post, for our protection<br />
from the rest of the legal beagles out there.  The US has twice<br />
as many lawyers as the rest of the world combined!<br />
<br />
You are free to delete the headers and just keep the Etexts, we<br />
are not free not to post it this way.  Again my apologies.  The<br />
normal Project Gutenberg blurb has been deleted, you can get it<br />
in this location in most Project Gutenberg Etexts.  Thanks,  mh<br />

Why is this &quot;Small Print!&quot; statement here?  You know: lawyers.<br />
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with<br />
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from<br />
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our<br />
fault.  So, among other things, this &quot;Small Print!&quot; statement<br />
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how<br />
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.<br />
<br />

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS<br />
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-<br />
tm etexts, is a &quot;public domain&quot; work distributed by Professor<br />
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at<br />
Illinois Benedictine College (the &quot;Project&quot;).  Among other<br />
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright<br />
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and<br />
distribute it in the United States without permission and<br />
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth<br />
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext<br />
under the Project's &quot;PROJECT GUTENBERG&quot; trademark.<br />
<br />
To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable<br />
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain<br />
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any<br />
medium they may be on may contain &quot;Defects&quot;.  Among other<br />
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or<br />
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other<br />
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged<br />
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer<br />
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.<br />
<br />
LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES<br />
But for the &quot;Right of Replacement or Refund&quot; described below,<br />
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this<br />
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all<br />
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including<br />
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR<br />
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,<br />
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE<br />

POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br />
<br />
If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of<br />
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)<br />
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that<br />
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it<br />
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and<br />
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement<br />
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may<br />
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to<br />
receive it electronically.<br />
<br />
THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU &quot;AS-IS&quot;.  NO OTHER<br />
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS<br />

LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A<br />
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.<br />

the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the<br />

<h2 id="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@6@6-h@6-h-0.htm.html#pgepubid00001">Patrick Henry, March 23, 1775.</h2>
<p>No man thinks more highly than I do of the patriotism, as well as abilities, of the very worthy gentlemen who have just addressed the House. But different men often see the same subject in different lights; and, therefore, I hope it will not be thought disrespectful to those gentlemen if, entertaining as I do opinions of a character very opposite to theirs, I shall speak forth my sentiments freely and without reserve. This is no time for ceremony. The question before the House is one of awful moment to this country. For my own part, I consider it as nothing less than a question of freedom or slavery; and in proportion to the magnitude of the subject ought to be the freedom of the debate. It is only in this way that we can hope to arrive at truth, and fulfill the great responsibility which we hold to God and our country. Should I keep back my opinions at such a time, through fear of giving offense, I should consider myself as guilty of treason towards my country, and of an act of disloyalty toward the Majesty of Heaven, which I revere above all earthly kings.</p>
<p>Mr. President, it is natural to man to indulge in the illusions of hope. We are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth, and listen to the song of that siren till she transforms us into beasts. Is this the part of wise men, engaged in a great and arduous struggle for liberty? Are we disposed to be of the number of those who, having eyes, see not, and, having ears, hear not, the things which so nearly concern their temporal salvation? For my part, whatever anguish of spirit it may cost, I am willing to know the whole truth; to know the worst, and to provide for it.</p>
<p>I have but one lamp by which my feet are guided, and that is the lamp of experience. I know of no way of judging of the future but by the past. And judging by the past, I wish to know what there has been in the conduct of the British ministry for the last ten years to justify those hopes with which gentlemen have been pleased to solace themselves and the House. Is it that insidious smile with which our petition has been lately received? Trust it not, sir; it will prove a snare to your feet. Suffer not yourselves to be betrayed with a kiss. Ask yourselves how this gracious reception of our petition comports with those warlike preparations which cover our waters and darken our land. Are fleets and armies necessary to a work of love and reconciliation? Have we shown ourselves so unwilling to be reconciled that force must be called in to win back our love? Let us not deceive ourselves, sir. These are the implements of war and subjugation; the last arguments to which kings resort. I ask gentlemen, sir, what means this martial array, if its purpose be not to force us to submission? Can gentlemen assign any other possible motive for it? Has Great Britain any enemy, in this quarter of the world, to call for all this accumulation of navies and armies? No, sir, she has none. They are meant for us: they can be meant for no other. They are sent over to bind and rivet upon us those chains which the British ministry have been so long forging. And what have we to oppose to them? Shall we try argument? Sir, we have been trying that for the last ten years. Have we anything new to offer upon the subject? Nothing. We have held the subject up in every light of which it is capable; but it has been all in vain. Shall we resort to entreaty and humble supplication? What terms shall we find which have not been already exhausted? Let us not, I beseech you, sir, deceive ourselves. Sir, we have done everything that could be done to avert the storm which is now coming on. We have petitioned; we have remonstrated; we have supplicated; we have prostrated ourselves before the throne, and have implored its interposition to arrest the tyrannical hands of the ministry and Parliament. Our petitions have been slighted; our remonstrances have produced additional violence and insult; our supplications have been disregarded; and we have been spurned, with contempt, from the foot of the throne! In vain, after these things, may we indulge the fond hope of peace and reconciliation. There is no longer any room for hope. If we wish to be free—if we mean to preserve inviolate those inestimable privileges for which we have been so long contending—if we mean not basely to abandon the noble struggle in which we have been so long engaged, and which we have pledged ourselves never to abandon until the glorious object of our contest shall be obtained—we must fight! I repeat it, sir, we must fight! An appeal to arms and to the God of hosts is all that is left us!</p>
<p>They tell us, sir, that we are weak; unable to cope with so formidable an adversary. But when shall we be stronger? Will it be the next week, or the next year? Will it be when we are totally disarmed, and when a British guard shall be stationed in every house? Shall we gather strength by irresolution and inaction? Shall we acquire the means of effectual resistance by lying supinely on our backs and hugging the delusive phantom of hope, until our enemies shall have bound us hand and foot? Sir, we are not weak if we make a proper use of those means which the God of nature hath placed in our power. The millions of people, armed in the holy cause of liberty, and in such a country as that which we possess, are invincible by any force which our enemy can send against us. Besides, sir, we shall not fight our battles alone. There is a just God who presides over the destinies of nations, and who will raise up friends to fight our battles for us. The battle, sir, is not to the strong alone; it is to the vigilant, the active, the brave. Besides, sir, we have no election. If we were base enough to desire it, it is now too late to retire from the contest. There is no retreat but in submission and slavery! Our chains are forged! Their clanking may be heard on the plains of Boston! The war is inevitable—and let it come! I repeat it, sir, let it come.</p>
<p>It is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter. Gentlemen may cry, Peace, Peace—but there is no peace. The war is actually begun! The next gale that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms! Our brethren are already in the field! Why stand we here idle? What is it that gentlemen wish? What would they have? Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty or give me death!</p>
