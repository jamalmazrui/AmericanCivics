margin-left:-.75pt'>First published in 1953 by the Committee on the Judiciary
of the House of Representatives, this 24th edition of ‘‘How Our Laws Are Made’’
reflects changes in congressional procedures since the 23rd edition, which was
revised and updated in 2003. This edition was prepared by the Office of the
Parliamentarian of the U.S. House of Representatives in consultation with the
Office of the Parliamentarian of the U.S. Senate. </p>

government resting on the concept of ‘‘separation of powers.’’ </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>In Article I, Section 1, of the Constitution, the
Legislative Branch is created by the following language: ‘‘All legislative
Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which
shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.’’ Article I, Section 5,
of the Constitution provides that: ‘‘Each House may determine the Rules of its
Proceedings, . . .’’. </p>

margin-left:-.75pt'>Upon this elegant, yet simple, grant of legislative powers
and rulemaking authority has grown an exceedingly complex and evolving
legislative process—much of it unique to each House of Congress. To aid the
public’s understanding of the legislative process, we have revised this popular
brochure. For more detailed information on how our laws are made and for the
text of the laws themselves, the reader should refer to government internet
sites or pertinent House and Senate publications available from the

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>This brochure is intended to provide a basic outline of the
numerous steps of our federal lawmaking process from the source of an idea for
a legislative proposal through its publication as a statute. The legislative
process is a matter about which every person should be well informed in order
to understand and appreciate the work of Congress. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>It is hoped that this guide will enable readers to gain a
greater understanding of the federal legislative process and its role as one of
the foundations of our representative system. One of the most practical
safeguards of the American democratic way of life is this legislative process
with its emphasis on the protection of the minority, allowing ample opportunity
to all sides to be heard and make their views known. The fact that a proposal
cannot become a law without consideration and approval by both Houses of
Congress is an outstanding virtue of our bicameral legislative system. The open
and full discussion provided under the Constitution often results in the notable
improvement of a bill by amendment before it becomes law or in the eventual
defeat of an inadvisable proposal. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.8pt;

Representatives, this discussion will focus principally on the procedure in

margin-left:-.75pt'>The Senate is composed of 100 Members—two from each state,
regardless of population or area—elected by the people in accordance with the
17th Amendment to the Constitution. The 17th Amendment changed the former
constitutional method under which Senators were chosen by the respective state
legislatures. A Senator must be at least 30 years of age, have been a citizen
of the United States for nine years, and, when elected, be an inhabitant of the
state for which the Senator is chosen. The term of office is six years and one-third
of the total membership of the Senate is </p>

both Senators from a particular state are arranged so that they do not
terminate at the same time. Of the two Senators from a state serving at the
same time the one who was elected first—or if both were elected at the same
time, the one elected for a full term—is referred to as the ‘‘senior’’ Senator
from that state. The other is referred to as the ‘‘junior’’ Senator. If a
Senator dies or resigns during the term, the governor of the state must call a
special election unless the state legislature has authorized the governor to
appoint a successor until the next election, at which time a successor is
elected for the balance of the term. Most of the state legislatures have
granted their governors the power of appointment. </p>

margin-left:-.75pt'>As constituted in the 110th Congress, the House of
Representatives is composed of 435 Members elected every two years from among
the 50 states, apportioned to their total populations. The permanent number of
435 was established by federal law following the Thirteenth Decennial Census in
1910, in accordance with Article I, Section 2, of the Constitution. This number
was increased temporarily to 437 for the 87th Congress to provide for one
Representative each for Alaska and Hawaii. The Constitution limits the number
of Representatives to not more than one for every 30,000 of population. Under a
former apportionment in one state, a particular Representative represented more
than 900,000 constituents, while another in the same state was elected from a
district having a population of only 175,000. The Supreme Court has since held
unconstitutional a Missouri statute permitting a maximum population variance of
3.1 percent from mathematical equality. The Court ruled in <i>Kirkpatrick </i>v.
<i>Preisler</i>, 394 U.S. 526 (1969), that the variances among the districts
were not unavoidable and, therefore, were invalid. That decision was an
interpretation of the Court’s earlier ruling in <i>Wesberry </i>v. <i>Sanders</i>,
376 U.S. 1 (1964), that the Constitution requires that ‘‘as nearly as is
practicable one man’s vote in a congressional election is to be worth as much
as another’s.’’ </p>

except in those less populous states entitled to only one Representative. An
‘‘at-large’’ election is one in which a Representative is elected by the voters

within the state. </p>

a Resident Commissioner from the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and Delegates from

four-year term, and the Delegates, elected for two-year terms, have most of the
prerogatives of Representatives including the right to vote in committees to
which they are elected, the right to vote in the Committee of the Whole
(subject to an automatic revote in the House whenever a recorded vote has been
decided by a margin within which the votes cast by the Delegates and the
Resident Commissioner have been decisive), and the right to preside over the
Committee of the Whole. However, the Resident Commissioner and the Delegates do
not have the right to vote on matters before the House. </p>

rules of its proceedings. Pursuant to that authority, the House of
Representatives adopts its rules anew each Congress, ordinarily on the opening

the House of Representatives have equal legislative functions and powers with
certain exceptions. For example, the Constitution provides that only the House
of Representatives may originate revenue bills. By tradition, the House also
originates appropriation bills. As both bodies have equal legislative powers,
the designation of one as the ‘‘upper’’ House and the other as the ‘‘lower’’
House is not applicable. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:78.8pt;

addition, the Senate has the function of advising and consenting to treaties
and to certain nominations by the President. Under the 25th Amendment to the

nomination for Vice-President when there is a vacancy in that office. In the

Senate sits as a court to try the impeachment. No impeached person may be
removed without a two-thirds vote of those Senators voting, a quorum being
present. The Congress under the Constitution and by statute also plays a role
in presidential elections. Both Houses meet in joint session on the sixth day
of January following a presidential election, unless by law they appoint a
different day, to count the electoral votes. If no candidate receives a
majority of the total electoral votes, the House of Representatives, each state
delegation having one vote, chooses the President from among the three
candidates having the largest number of electoral votes. The Senate, each
Senator having one vote, chooses the Vice President from the two candidates
having the largest number of votes for that office. </p>

SOURCES OF LEGISLATION </span></b></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>Sources of ideas for legislation are unlimited and proposed
drafts of bills originate in many diverse quarters. Primary among these is the
idea and draft conceived by a Member. This may emanate from the election
campaign during which the Member had promised, if elected, to introduce
legislation on a particular subject. The Member may have also become aware
after taking office of the need for amendment to or repeal of an existing law
or the enactment of a statute in an entirely new field. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>In addition, the Member’s constituents, either as
individuals or through citizen groups, may avail themselves of the right to
petition and transmit their proposals to the Member. The right to petition is
guaranteed by the First Amendment to the Constitution. Similarly, state
legislatures may ‘‘memorialize’’ Congress to enact specified federal laws by
passing resolutions to be transmitted to the House and Senate as memorials. If
favorably impressed by the idea, a Member may introduce the proposal in the
form in which it has been submitted or may redraft it. In any event, a Member
may consult with the Legislative Counsel of the House or the Senate to frame
the ideas in suitable legislative language and form. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:78.8pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>In modern times, the ‘‘executive communication’’ has become
a prolific source of legislative proposals. The communication is usually in the
form of a message or letter from a member of the President’s Cabinet, the head
of an independent agency, or the President himself, transmitting a draft of a
proposed bill to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President
of the Senate. Despite the structure of separation of powers, Article II,
Section 3, of the Constitution imposes an obligation on the President to report
to Congress from time to time on the ‘‘State of the Union’’ and to recommend
for consideration such measures as the President considers necessary and
expedient. Many of these executive commu-</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>nications follow on the President’s message
to Congress on the state of the Union. The communication is then referred to
the standing committee or committees having jurisdiction of the subject matter
of the proposal. The chairman or the ranking minority member of the relevant
committee often introduces the bill, either in the form in which it was
received or with desired changes. This practice is usually followed even when
the majority of the House and the President are not of the same political
party, although there is no constitutional or statutory requirement that a bill
be introduced to effectuate the recommendations. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>The most important of the regular executive communications
is the annual message from the President transmitting the proposed budget to
Congress. The President’s budget proposal, together with testimony by officials
of the various branches of the government before the Appropriations Committees
of the House and Senate, is the basis of the several appropriation bills that
are drafted by the Committees on Appropriations of the House and Senate. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>The drafting of statutes is an art that requires great
skill, knowledge, and experience. In some instances, a draft is the result of a
study covering a period of a year or more by a commission or committee
designated by the President or a member of the Cabinet. The Administrative
Procedure Act and the Uniform Code of Military Justice are two examples of
enactments resulting from such studies. In addition, congressional committees
sometimes draft bills after studies and hearings covering periods of a year or
more. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>The work of Congress is initiated by the introduction of a
proposal in one of four forms: the bill, the joint resolution, the concurrent
resolution, and the simple resolution. The most customary form used in both
Houses is the bill. During the 109th Congress (2005–2006), 10,558 bills and 143
joint resolutions were introduced in both Houses. Of the total number
introduced, 6,436 bills and 102 joint resolutions originated in the House of
Representatives. </p>

Puerto Rico in the House of Representatives may introduce a bill at any time
while the House is in session by simply placing it in the ‘‘hopper,’’ a wooden
box provided for that purpose located on the side of the rostrum in the House
Chamber. Permission is not required to introduce the measure. The Member
introducing the bill is known as the primary sponsor. Except in the case of
private bills, an unlimited number of Members may cosponsor a bill. To prevent
the possibility that a bill might be introduced in the House on behalf of a
Member without that Member’s prior approval, the primary sponsor’s signature
must appear on the bill before it is accepted for introduction. Members who
cosponsor a bill upon its date of introduction are original cosponsors. Members
who cosponsor a bill after its introduction are additional cosponsors.
Cosponsors are not required to sign the bill. A Member may not be added or
deleted as a cosponsor after the bill has been reported by, or discharged from,
the last committee authorized to consider it, and the Speaker may not entertain
a request to delete the name of the primary sponsor at any time. Cosponsors’
names may be deleted by their own unanimous-consent request or that of the
primary sponsor. In the Senate, unlimited multiple sponsorship of a bill is
permitted. A Member may insert the words ‘‘by request’’ after the Member’s name
to indicate that the introduction of the measure is at the suggestion of some
other person or group—usually the President or a member of his Cabinet. </p>

statement. </p>

to read bills—even by title—at the time of introduction. The title is entered
in the Journal and printed in the Congressional Record, thus preserving the
purpose of the custom. The bill is assigned its legislative number by the
Clerk. The bill is then referred as required by the rules of the House to the
appropriate committee or committees by the Speaker, with the assistance of the
Parliamentarian. The bill number and committee referral appear in the next
issue of the Congressional Record. It is then sent to the Government Printing
Office where it is printed and copies are made available in the document rooms
of both Houses. Printed and electronic versions of the bill are also made
available to the public. </p>

margin-left:-.75pt'>Perhaps the most important phase of the legislative process
is the action by committees. The committees provide the most intensive
consideration to a proposed measure as well as the forum where the public is
given their opportunity to be heard. A tremendous volume of work, often
overlooked by the public, is done by the Members in this phase. There are, at
present, 20 standing committees in the House and 16 in the Senate as well as
several select committees. In addition, there are four standing joint
committees of the two Houses, with oversight responsibilities but no
legislative jurisdiction. The House may also create select committees or task
forces to study specific issues and report on them to the House. A task force may
be established formally through a resolution passed by the House or informally
through organization of interested Members by the House leadership. </p>

measures relating to judicial proceedings and 18 other categories, including
constitutional amendments, immigration policy, bankruptcy, patents, copyrights,
and trademarks. In total, the rules of the House and of the Senate each provide
for over 200 different classifications of measures to be referred to

committees for consideration of those provisions of the bill within the
jurisdiction of each committee concerned. Except in extraordinary
circumstances, the Speaker must designate a primary committee of jurisdiction
on bills referred to multiple committees. The Speaker may place time limits on
the consideration of bills by all committees, but usually time limits are
placed only on additional committees to which a bill has been referred
following the report of the primary committee. </p>

respective party caucuses nominate Members of the caucus to be elected to each
standing committee at the beginning of each Congress. Membership on a standing
committee during the course of a Congress is contingent on continuing
membership in the party caucus that nominated a Member for election to the
committee. If a Member ceases to be a Member of the party caucus, a Member
automatically ceases to be a member of the standing committee. </p>

enacting the bill into law. Normally, ample time is given for the submission of
the reports and they are accorded serious consideration. However, these reports
are not binding on the committee in determining whether or not to act favorably
on the bill. Reports of the departments and agencies in the executive branch
are submitted first to the Office of Management and Budget to determine whether
they are consistent with the program of the President. Many committees adopt

the changes in the bill upon adoption of the rule. The rule may also make a
specified ‘‘manager’s amendment’’ in order prior to any other amendment or may
make a ‘‘compromise substitute’’ amendment in order as original text to replace
the version reported from committee. When a rule limits or prevents floor
amendments, it is popularly known as a ‘‘closed rule’’ or ‘‘modified closed

the rights, reputation, and conduct of individual Members, may be raised from
the floor without formal notice and does not result in a vote. Debate on a

privileged, including reports from the Committee on Rules, reports from the
Committee on Appropriations on general appropriation bills, printing and
committee funding resolutions reported from the Committee on House
Administration, and reports on Member’s conduct from the Committee on Standards
of Official Conduct. Bills, joint resolutions, and motions may also take on
privileged status as a result of special procedures written into statute. The
Member in charge of such a matter may call it up at practically any time for
immediate consideration when no other business is pending. Usually, this is
done after consultation with both the majority and minority floor leaders so

measures on the Union Calendar— those involving a tax, making appropriations,
authorizing payments out of appropriations already made, or disposing of

</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>The rule referred to in the preceding paragraph also fixes
the length of the debate in the Committee of the Whole. This may vary according
to the importance of the measure. As provided in the rule, the control of the
time is usually divided equally between the chairman and the ranking minority
member of the relevant committee. Members seeking to speak for or against the
measure may arrange in advance with the Member in control of the time on their
respective side to be allowed a certain amount of time in the debate. Members
may also ask the Member speaking at the time to yield to them for a question or
a brief statement. A transcript of the proceedings in the House and the Senate
is printed daily in the Congressional Record. Frequently, permission is granted
a Member by unanimous consent to revise and extend his remarks in the
Congressional Record if sufficient time to make a lengthy oral statement is not
available during actual debate. These revisions and extensions are printed in a
distinctive type and cannot substantively alter the verbatim transcript. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;

time used on both sides is kept and the Chairman terminates the debate when all
the time allowed under the rule has been consumed. After general debate, the
second reading of the bill begins. The second reading is a section-by-section
reading during which amendments may be offered to a section when it is read.
Under many special ‘‘modified closed’’ rules adopted by the House, certain
bills are considered as read and open only to prescribed amendments under
limited time allocations. Under an ‘‘open’’ amendment process, a Member is
permitted five minutes to explain the proposed amendment, after which the
Member who is first recognized by the Chair is allowed to speak for five
minutes in opposition to it. There is technically no further debate on that
amendment, thereby effectively preventing filibuster-like tactics. This is
known as the ‘‘five- minute rule.’’ However, Members may offer an amendment to
the amendment, for separate five-minute debate, or may offer a pro forma
amendment—‘‘to strike the last word’’—which does not change the language of the
amendment but allows the Member five minutes for debate. Each substantive
amendment and amendment thereto is put to the Committee of the Whole for
adoption unless the House has adopted a special rule ‘‘self-executing’’ the
adoption of certain amendments in the Committee of the Whole. The House may,
after initially adopting an open rule, later alter that rule by unanimous
consent to establish a ‘‘universe’’ or list of amendments to a bill. This
procedure is most commonly used on general appropriation bills because of the
volume of amendments. </p>

a section or paragraph before there has been debate on an amendment that a
Member has caused to be printed in the Congressional Record at least one day
prior to floor consideration of the amendment, the Member who caused the

report, the list or statement must be included in the joint explanatory
statement prepared by the managers of the House and the managers of the Senate.

of the House to compel the attendance of absent Members. Such a call of the
House must be ordered by a majority vote. A call of the House is then ordered
and the call is taken by electronic device or by response to the alphabetical
call of the roll of Members. Absent Members have a minimum of 15 minutes from
the ordering of the call of the House by electronic device to have their
presence recorded. If sufficient excuse is not offered for their absence, they
may be sent for by the Sergeant-at-Arms and their attendance secured and
retained. The House then determines the conditions on which they may be
discharged. Members who voluntarily appear are, unless the House otherwise
directs, immediately admitted to the Hall of the House and must report their
names to the Clerk to be entered on the Journal as present. Compulsory

in the Committee of the Whole. The first time the Committee of the Whole finds
itself without a quorum during a day the Chairman is required to order the roll
to be called by electronic device, unless the Chairman orders a call of the
Committee. However, the Chairman may refuse to entertain a point of order of no
quorum during general debate. If on a call, a quorum (100 Members) appears, the
Committee continues its business. If a quorum does not appear, the Committee
rises and the Chairman reports the names of the absentees to the House. The
rules provide for the expeditious conduct of quorum calls in the Committee of
the Whole. The Chairman may suspend a quorum call after 100 Members have
recorded their presence. Under such a short quorum call, the Committee will not
rise and proceedings under the quorum call are vacated. In that case, a
recorded vote, if ordered immediately following the termination of the short
quorum call, is a minimum of 15 minutes. In the alternative, the Chair may
choose to permit a full 15-minute quorum call, wherein all Members are recorded
as present or absent, to be followed by a five-minute record vote on the
pending question. Once a quorum of the Committee of the Whole has been
established for a day, a quorum call in the Committee is only in order when the
Committee is operating under the five-minute rule and the Chairman has put the
pending question to a vote. The rules prohibit a point of order of no quorum
against a vote in which the Committee of the Whole agrees to rise. However, an
appropriate point of no quorum would be permitted against a vote defeating a
motion to rise. </p>

PROCESS </h4>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>The Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of
1974, as amended, provides Congress with a procedure to establish appropriate
spending and revenue levels for each year. The congressional budget process, as
set out in that Act, is designed to coordinate decisions on sources and levels
of revenues and on objects and levels of expenditures. Its basic method is to
prescribe the overall size of the fiscal pie and the particular sizes of its
various pieces. Each year the Congress adopts a concurrent resolution imposing
overall constraints on revenues and spending and distributing the overall
constraint on spending among groups of programs and activities. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>Congress aims to complete action on a concurrent resolution
on the budget for the next fiscal year by April 15. Congress may adopt a later
budget resolution that revises the most recently adopted budget resolution. One
of the mechanisms Congress uses to implement the constraints on revenue and
spending is called the reconciliation process. Reconciliation is a
multiple-step process designed to bring existing law in conformity with the
most recently adopted concurrent resolution on the budget. The first step in
the reconciliation process is the language found in a concurrent resolution on
the budget instructing House and Senate committees to determine and recommend
changes in laws that will achieve the constraints established in the concurrent
resolution on the budget. The instructions to a committee specify the amount of
spending reductions or revenue changes a committee must attain and leave to the
discretion of the committee the specific changes to laws or bills that must be
made. The subsequent steps involve the combination of the various instructed
committees’ recommendations into an omnibus reconciliation bill or bills which
are reported by the Committee on the Budget or by the one committee instructed,
if only one committee has been instructed, and considered by the House. In the
Senate, reconciliation bills reported from committee are entitled to expedited
consideration, permitting a majority of Senators, rather than sixty, to ensure
consideration of the bill with limited time for amendments. Congress aims to
complete action on reconciliation measures by a specified date each year. </p>

government. The Act also established a unique point of order to enforce the

extent from those in the House. The Senate relies heavily on the practice of
obtaining unanimous consent for actions to be taken. For example, at the time
that a bill is reported, the Majority Leader may ask unanimous consent for the
immediate consideration of the bill. If the bill is of a noncontroversial
nature and there is no objection, the Senate may pass the bill with little or
no debate and with only a brief explanation of its purpose and effect. If there
is any objection, the report must lie over one legislative day and the bill is

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:78.8pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>In the Senate, measures are brought up for consideration by
a simple unanimous consent request, by a complex unanimous consent agreement,
or by a motion to proceed to the consideration of a measure on the calendar. A
unanimous consent agreement, sometimes referred to as a ‘‘time agreement’’,
makes the consideration of a measure in order and often limits the amount of
debate that will take place on the measure and lists the amendments that will
be considered. The offering of a unanimous consent request to consider a
measure or the offering of a motion to proceed to the consideration of a
measure is reserved, by tradition, to the Majority Leader. Usually, a motion to
consider a measure on the calendar is made only when unanimous consent to
consider the measure cannot be obtained. </p>

Business and the Executive Calendar. All legislation is placed on the Calendar
of Business and treaties and nominations are placed on the Executive Calendar.
Unlike the House, there is no differentiation on the Calendar of Business

bills, and bills of a public character appropriating money or property; and (2)
other bills of a public character not appropriating money or property. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>The rules of the Senate provide that at the conclusion of
the morning business for each ‘‘legislative day’’ the Senate proceeds to the
consideration of the calendar. In the Senate, the term ‘‘legislative day’’
means the period of time from when the Senate adjourns until the next time the
Senate adjourns. Because the Senate often ‘‘recesses’’ rather than ‘‘adjourns’’
at the end of a daily session, the legislative day usually does not correspond
to the 24-hour period comprising a calendar day. Thus, a legislative day may
cover a long period of time—from days to weeks, or even months. Because of this
and the modern practice of waiving the call of the calendar by unanimous
consent at the start of a new legislative day, it is rare to have a call of the
calendar. When the calendar is called, bills that are not objected to are taken
up in their order, and each Senator is entitled to speak once and for five
minutes only on any question. Objection may be interposed at any stage of the
proceedings, but on motion the Senate may continue consideration after the call
of the calendar is completed, and the limitations on debate then do not apply. </p>

legislative day), following the announcement of the close of morning business,
any Senator, usually the Majority Leader, obtaining recognition may move to
take up any bill out of its regular order on the calendar. The five-minute
limitation on debate does not apply to the consideration of a bill taken up in
this manner, and debate may continue until the hour when the Presiding Officer
of the Senate ‘‘lays down’’ the unfinished business of the day. At that point
consideration of the bill is discontinued and the measure reverts back to the
Calendar of Business and may again be called up at another time under the same
conditions. </p>

debatable if made after the morning hour. </p>

is concluded. </p>

debate by making lengthy speeches or a number of speeches at various stages of
consideration intended to prevent or defeat action on the measure. This is the
tactic known as ‘‘filibustering.’’ Debate may be closed, however, if 16
Senators sign a motion to that effect and the motion is carried by three-fifths
of the Senators duly chosen and sworn. Such a motion is voted on one hour after
the Senate convenes, following a quorum call on the next day after a day of
session has intervened. This procedure is called ‘‘invoking cloture.’’ In 1986,
the Senate amended its rules to limit ‘‘post-cloture’’ consideration to 30
hours. ‘‘Post-cloture,’’ a Senator may speak for not more than one hour and may
yield all or a part of that time to the majority or minority floor managers of
the bill under consideration or to the Majority or Minority leader. The Senate
may increase the time for ‘‘post-cloture’’ debate by a vote of three-fifths of
the Senators duly chosen and sworn. After the time for debate has expired, the
Senate may consider only amendments actually pending before voting on the bill.

the case of general appropriation bills or where ‘‘cloture’’ has been invoked.
Under the rules, a ‘‘rider’’, an amendment proposing substantive legislation to
an appropriation bill, is prohibited. However, this prohibition may be
suspended by two-thirds vote on a motion to permit consideration of such an
amendment on one day’s notice in writing. Debate must be germane during the

on the Senate amendments. Although rarely exercised, the Speaker has the
authority to refer Senate amendments to the appropriate committee or committees

minor or noncontroversial nature, any Member, usually the chairman of a
committee that reported the bill, may, at the direction of the committee, ask
unanimous consent to take the bill with the amendments from the Speaker’s table
and agree to the Senate amendments. At this point, the Clerk reads the title of
the bill and the Senate amendments. If there is no objection, the amendments
are then declared to be agreed to, and the bill is ready to be enrolled for
presentation to the President. If unanimous consent is not obtainable, the few
bills that do not require consideration in the Committee of the Whole are
privileged and may be called up from the Speaker’s table by motion for
immediate consideration of the amendments. A simple majority is necessary to
carry the motion and thereby complete floor action on the measure. A Senate
amendment to a House bill is subject to a point of order that it must first be

its own bill on a subject is not sufficient to make either bill eligible for
conference. One House must first take the additional step of amending and then
passing the bill of the other House to form the basis for a conference. A
Member, usually the chairman of the committee of jurisdiction, may request
unanimous consent to take the House bill with the Senate amendments from the
Speaker’s table, disagree to the amendments and request or agree to a conference
with the Senate to resolve the disagreeing votes of the two Houses. In the case
of a Senate bill with House amendments, the House may insist on the House
amendments and request a conference. For a discussion of bills originating in
the Senate, see Part XVI. If there is objection, the Speaker may recognize a
Member for a motion, if offered by the direction of the primary committee and
of all reporting committees that had initial referral of the bill, to: (1)
disagree to the Senate amendments and ask for or agree to a conference; or (2)
insist on the House amendments to a Senate bill and request or agree to a
conference. This may also be accomplished by a motion to suspend the rules with
a two-thirds vote or by a rule from the Committee on Rules. If there is no
objection to the request, or if the motion is carried, a motion to instruct the
managers of the conference would be in order. This initial motion to instruct
is the prerogative of the minority party. The instructions to conferees usually
urge the managers to accept or reject a particular Senate or House provision or
to take a more generally described political position to the extent possible
within the scope of the conference. However, such instructions may not contain
argument and are not binding on House or Senate conferees. After the motion to
instruct is disposed of, the Speaker then appoints the managers, informally
known as conferees, on the part of the House and a message is sent to the
Senate advising it of the House action. A majority of the Members appointed to
be conferees must have been supporters of the House position, as determined by
the Speaker. The Speaker must appoint Members primarily responsible for the
legislation and must include, to the fullest extent feasible, the principal proponents
of the major provisions of the bill as it passed the House. The Speaker may

appropriation bills with numbered Senate amendments, because of the special
rules preventing House conferees from agreeing to Senate amendments changing
existing law or appropriations not authorized by law, the conferees often found
themselves, under the rules or in fact, unable to reach an agreement with
respect to one or more amendments and reported back a statement of their
inability to agree on those particular amendments. These amendments were acted

by virtue of the constitutional provision that if the President does not return
a bill with objections within 10 days (excluding Sundays) after it has been
presented to the President, it becomes law as if the President had signed it.
However, if Congress by their adjournment prevent its return, it does not
become law. This is known as a ‘‘pocket veto;’’ that is, the bill does not
become law even though the President has not sent his objections to the
Congress. The Congress has interpreted the President’s ability to pocket veto a
bill to be limited to adjournment ‘‘sine die’’ of a Congress and not to interim
adjournments or first session adjournments where the originating House of
Congress through its agents is able to receive a veto message for subsequent
reconsideration by that same Congress when it reconvenes. The extent of pocket
veto authority has not been definitively decided by the courts. </p>

approve the bill ‘‘he shall return it, with his Objections to that House in

President’s objections need not be voted on at once when laid before the House
since the vetoed bill can be postponed, referred to committee, or tabled before
the question on passage is pending. A vetoed bill is always privileged until
directly voted upon, and a motion to take it from the table or from committee

‘‘Will the House, on reconsideration, pass the bill, the objections of the President
to the contrary notwithstanding?’’ Under the Constitution, a vote by the yeas
and nays is required to pass a bill over the President’s veto. The Clerk
activates the electronic system or calls the roll with those in favor of
passing the bill answering ‘‘Aye,’’ and those opposed ‘‘No.’’ If fewer than
two-thirds of the Members present vote in the affirmative, a quorum being
present, the bill is rejected, and a message is sent to the Senate advising
that body of the House action. However, if two-thirds vote in the affirmative,
the bill is sent with the President’s objections to the Senate, unless that
body has acted first, together with a message advising it of the action in the

the Line Item Veto Act provided the President authority to cancel certain
individual items contained in a bill or joint resolution that he had signed

items: a dollar amount of discretionary budget authority, an item of new direct
spending, or a tax change benefiting a class of 100 or fewer. While the Act has
not been repealed, the Supreme Court in <i>Clinton </i>v. <i>City of New York</i>,

such behavior. In practice, our laws are published immediately upon their

law for a public law also indicates the United States Statutes at Large

history of the law consisting of the committee report number, the name of the
committee in each House, as well as the date of consideration and passage in
each House, with a reference to the Congressional Record by volume, year, and
