<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.75pt;margin-bottom:
13.35pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>Good evening.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.75pt;margin-bottom:
13.35pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>This is the 37th time I have spoken to you from
this office, where so many decisions have been made that shaped the history of
this Nation. Each time I have done so to discuss with you some matter that I
believe affected the national interest.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.75pt;margin-bottom:
13.35pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>In all the decisions I have made in my public life,
I have always tried to do what was best for the Nation. Throughout the long and
difficult period of Watergate, I have felt it was my duty to persevere, to make
every possible effort to complete the term of office to which you elected me.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.75pt;margin-bottom:
13.35pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>In the past few days, however, it has become
evident to me that I no longer have a strong enough political base in the
Congress to justify continuing that effort. As long as there was such a base, I
felt strongly that it was necessary to see the constitutional process through
to its conclusion, that to do otherwise would be unfaithful to the spirit of
that deliberately difficult process and a dangerously destabilizing precedent
for the future.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.75pt;margin-bottom:
13.35pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>But with the disappearance of that base, I now
believe that the constitutional purpose has been served, and there is no longer
a need for the process to be prolonged.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.75pt;margin-bottom:
13.35pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>I would have preferred to carry through to the
finish whatever the personal agony it would have involved, and my family unanimously
urged me to do so. But the interest of the Nation must always come before any
personal considerations.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.75pt;margin-bottom:
13.35pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>From the discussions I have had with Congressional
and other leaders, I have concluded that because of the Watergate matter I
might not have the support of the Congress that I would consider necessary to
back the very difficult decisions and carry out the duties of this office in
the way the interests of the Nation would require.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.75pt;margin-bottom:
13.35pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>I have never been a quitter. To leave office before
my term is completed is abhorrent to every instinct in my body. But as
President, I must put the interest of America first. America needs a full-time
President and a full-time Congress, particularly at this time with problems we
face at home and abroad.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.75pt;margin-bottom:
13.35pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>To continue to fight through the months ahead for
my personal vindication would almost totally absorb the time and attention of
both the President and the Congress in a period when our entire focus should be
on the great issues of peace abroad and prosperity without inflation at home.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.75pt;margin-bottom:
13.35pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>Therefore, I shall resign the Presidency effective
at noon tomorrow. Vice President Ford will be sworn in as President at that
hour in this office.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.75pt;margin-bottom:
13.35pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>As I recall the high hopes for America with which
we began this second term, I feel a great sadness that I will not be here in
this office working on your behalf to achieve those hopes in the next 21/2
years. But in turning over direction of the Government to Vice President Ford,
I know, as I told the Nation when I nominated him for that office 10 months
ago, that the leadership of America will be in good hands.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.75pt;margin-bottom:
13.35pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>In passing this office to the Vice President, I
also do so with the profound sense of the weight of responsibility that will
fall on his shoulders tomorrow and, therefore, of the understanding, the
patience, the cooperation he will need from all Americans.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.75pt;margin-bottom:
13.35pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>As he assumes that responsibility, he will deserve
the help and the support of all of us. As we look to the future, the first
essential is to begin healing the wounds of this Nation, to put the bitterness
and divisions of the recent past behind us, and to rediscover those shared
ideals that lie at the heart of our strength and unity as a great and as a free
people.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.75pt;margin-bottom:
13.35pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>By taking this action, I hope that I will have
hastened the start of that process of healing which is so desperately needed in
America.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.75pt;margin-bottom:
13.35pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>I regret deeply any injuries that may have been
done in the course of the events that led to this decision. I would say only
that if some of my Judgments were wrong, and some were wrong, they were made in
what I believed at the time to be the best interest of the Nation.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.75pt;margin-bottom:
13.35pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>To those who have stood with me during these past
difficult months, to my family, my friends, to many others who joined in
supporting my cause because they believed it was right, I will be eternally
grateful for your support.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.75pt;margin-bottom:
13.35pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>And to those who have not felt able to give me your
support, let me say I leave with no bitterness toward those who have opposed
me, because all of us, in the final analysis, have been concerned with the good
of the country, however our judgments might differ.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.75pt;margin-bottom:
13.35pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>So, let us all now join together in affirming that
common commitment and in helping our new President succeed for the benefit of
all Americans.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.75pt;margin-bottom:
13.35pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>I shall leave this office with regret at not
completing my term, but with gratitude for the privilege of serving as your
President for the past 51/2 years. These years have been a momentous time in
the history of our Nation and the world. They have been a time of achievement
in which we can all be proud, achievements that represent the shared efforts of
the Administration, the Congress, and the people.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.75pt;margin-bottom:
13.35pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>But the challenges ahead are equally great, and
they, too, will require the support and the efforts of the Congress and the
people working in cooperation with the new Administration.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.75pt;margin-bottom:
13.35pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>We have ended America's longest war, but in the
work of securing a lasting peace in the world, the goals ahead are even more
far-reaching and more difficult. We must complete a structure of peace so that
it will be said of this generation, our generation of Americans, by the people
of all nations, not only that we ended one war but that we prevented future
wars.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.75pt;margin-bottom:
13.35pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>We have unlocked the doors that for a quarter of a
century stood between the United States and the People's Republic of China.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.75pt;margin-bottom:
13.35pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>We must now ensure that the one quarter of the
world's people who live in the People's Republic of China will be and remain
not our enemies but our friends.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.75pt;margin-bottom:
13.35pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>In the Middle East, 100 million people in the Arab
countries, many of whom have considered us their enemy for nearly 20 years, now
look on us as their friends. We must continue to build on that friendship so
that peace can settle at last over the Middle East and so that the cradle of
civilization will not become its grave.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.75pt;margin-bottom:
13.35pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>Together with the Soviet Union we have made the
crucial breakthroughs that have begun the process of limiting nuclear arms. But
we must set as our goal not just limiting but reducing and finally destroying
these terrible weapons so that they cannot destroy civilization and so that the
threat of nuclear war will no longer hang over the world and the people.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.75pt;margin-bottom:
13.35pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>We have opened the new relation with the Soviet
Union. We must continue to develop and expand that new relationship so that the
two strongest nations of the world will live together in cooperation rather
than confrontation.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.75pt;margin-bottom:
13.35pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>Around the world, in Asia, in Africa, in Latin
America, in the Middle East, there are millions of people who live in terrible
poverty, even starvation. We must keep as our goal turning away from production
for war and expanding production for peace so that people everywhere on this
earth can at last look forward in their children's time, if not in our own
time, to having the necessities for a decent life.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.75pt;margin-bottom:
13.35pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>Here in America, we are fortunate that most of our
people have not only the blessings of liberty but also the means to live full
and good and, by the world's standards, even abundant lives. We must press on,
however, toward a goal of not only more and better jobs but of full opportunity
for every American and of what we are striving so hard right now to achieve,
prosperity without inflation.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.75pt;margin-bottom:
13.35pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>For more than a quarter of a century in public life
I have shared in the turbulent history of this era. I have fought for what I
believed in. I have tried to the best of my ability to discharge those duties
and meet those responsibilities that were entrusted to me.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.75pt;margin-bottom:
13.35pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>Sometimes I have succeeded and sometimes I have
failed, but always I have taken heart from what Theodore Roosevelt once said
about the man in the arena, &quot;whose face is marred by dust and sweat and
blood, who strives valiantly, who errs and comes short again and again because
there is not effort without error and shortcoming, but who does actually strive
to do the deed, who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, who
spends himself in a worthy cause, who at the best knows in the end the triumphs
of high achievements and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while
daring greatly.&quot;  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.75pt;margin-bottom:
13.35pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>I pledge to you tonight that as long as I have a
breath of life in my body, I shall continue in that spirit. I shall continue to
work for the great causes to which I have been dedicated throughout my years as
a Congressman, a Senator, a Vice President, and President, the cause of peace
not just for America but among all nations, prosperity, justice, and
opportunity for all of our people.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.75pt;margin-bottom:
13.35pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>There is one cause above all to which I have been
devoted and to which I shall always be devoted for as long as I live.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.75pt;margin-bottom:
13.35pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>When I first took the oath of office as President
51/2 years ago, I made this sacred commitment, to &quot;consecrate my office,
my energies, and all the wisdom I can summon to the cause of peace among
nations.&quot;  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.75pt;margin-bottom:
13.35pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>I have done my very best in all the days since to
be true to that pledge. As a result of these efforts, I am confident that the
world is a safer place today, not only for the people of America but for the
people of all nations, and that all of our children have a better chance than
before of living in peace rather than dying in war.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.75pt;margin-bottom:
13.35pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>This, more than anything, is what I hoped to
achieve when I sought the Presidency. This, more than anything, is what I hope
will be my legacy to you, to our country, as I leave the Presidency.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.75pt;margin-bottom:
13.35pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>To have served in this office is to have felt a
very personal sense of kinship with each and every American. In leaving it, I
do so with this prayer: May God's grace be with you in all the days ahead.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.75pt;margin-bottom:
13.35pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>NOTE: The President spoke at 9: 01 p.m. in the Oval
Office at the White House. The address was broadcast live on radio and
television.  </p>
