**Welcome To The World of Free Plain Vanilla Electronic Texts**<br />

<br />
We apologize for the fact that the legal small print is longer,<br />
and more complicated, than the Etext itself, our legal beagles,<br />
of whom there are now a half dozen or so, insist this must be a<br />
part of any Project Gutenberg Etext we post, for our protection<br />
from the rest of the legal beagles out there.  The US has twice<br />
as many lawyers as the rest of the world combined!<br />
<br />
You are free to delete the headers and just keep the Etexts, we<br />
are not free not to post it this way.  Again my apologies.  The<br />
normal Project Gutenberg blurb has been deleted, you can get it<br />
in this location in most Project Gutenberg Etexts.  Thanks,  mh<br />

***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN ETEXTS**START***<br />
Why is this &quot;Small Print!&quot; statement here?  You know: lawyers.<br />
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with<br />
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from<br />
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our<br />
fault.  So, among other things, this &quot;Small Print!&quot; statement<br />
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how<br />
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.<br />
<br />
*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT<br />
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm<br />
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept<br />
this &quot;Small Print!&quot; statement.  If you do not, you can receive<br />
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by<br />
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person<br />
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical<br />
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.<br />
<br />
ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS<br />
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-<br />
tm etexts, is a &quot;public domain&quot; work distributed by Professor<br />
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at<br />
Illinois Benedictine College (the &quot;Project&quot;).  Among other<br />
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright<br />
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and<br />
distribute it in the United States without permission and<br />
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth<br />
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext<br />
under the Project's &quot;PROJECT GUTENBERG&quot; trademark.<br />
<br />
To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable<br />
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain<br />
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any<br />
medium they may be on may contain &quot;Defects&quot;.  Among other<br />
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or<br />
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other<br />
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged<br />
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer<br />
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.<br />
<br />
LIMTED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES<br />
But for the &quot;Right of Replacement or Refund&quot; described below,<br />
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this<br />
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all<br />
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including<br />
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR<br />
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,<br />
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE<br />
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE<br />
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br />
<br />
If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of<br />
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)<br />
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that<br />
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it<br />
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and<br />
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement<br />
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may<br />
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to<br />
receive it electronically.<br />
<br />
THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU &quot;AS-IS&quot;.  NO OTHER<br />
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS<br />
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT<br />
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A<br />
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.<br />
<br />
Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or<br />
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the<br />
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you<br />
may have other legal rights.<br />
<br />
INDEMNITY<br />
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,<br />
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost<br />
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or<br />
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:<br />
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,<br />
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.<br />
<br />
DISTRIBUTION UNDER &quot;PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm&quot;<br />
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by<br />
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this<br />
&quot;Small Print!&quot; and all other references to Project Gutenberg,<br />
or:<br />
<br />
[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this<br />
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the<br />
     etext or this &quot;small print!&quot; statement.  You may however,<br />
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable<br />
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,<br />
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-<br />
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as<br />
     *EITHER*:<br />
<br />
     [*]  The etext, when displayed, is clearly readable, and<br />
          does *not* contain characters other than those<br />
          intended by the author of the work, although tilde<br />
          (~), asterisk (*) and underline (_) characters may<br />
          be used to convey punctuation intended by the<br />
          author, and additional characters may be used to<br />
          indicate hypertext links; OR<br />
<br />
     [*]  The etext may be readily converted by the reader at<br />
          no expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent<br />

          OR<br />
<br />
     [*]  You provide, or agree to also provide on request at<br />
          no additional cost, fee or expense, a copy of the<br />
          etext in its original plain ASCII form (or in EBCDIC<br />

<br />
[2]  Honor the etext refund and replacement provisions of this<br />
     &quot;Small Print!&quot; statement.<br />
<br />
[3]  Pay a trademark license fee to the Project of 20% of the<br />
     net profits you derive calculated using the method you<br />
     already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  If you<br />
     don't derive profits, no royalty is due.  Royalties are<br />
     payable to &quot;Project Gutenberg Association / Illinois<br />
     Benedictine College&quot; within the 60 days following each<br />
     date you prepare (or were legally required to prepare)<br />
     your annual (or equivalent periodic) tax return.<br />
<br />
WHAT IF YOU *WANT* TO SEND MONEY EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO?<br />
The Project gratefully accepts contributions in money, time,<br />
scanning machines, OCR software, public domain etexts, royalty<br />
free copyright licenses, and every other sort of contribution<br />
you can think of.  Money should be paid to &quot;Project Gutenberg<br />

<br />
All of the original Project Gutenberg Etexts from the<br />
1970's were produced in ALL CAPS, no lower case.  The<br />
computers we used then didn't have lower case at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is a retranscription of one of the first Project<br />
Gutenberg Etexts, offically dated December 31, 1974--<br />
and now officially re-released on November 19, 1993--<br />
130 years after it was spoken.  We will rerelease the<br />
Inaugural Address of President Kennedy, officially on<br />
November 22, 1993, on the day of the 30th anniversary<br />
of his assassination.<br />

given November 19, 1863<br />
on the battlefield near<br />
Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, USA</h1>
<br />

<p>Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth upon this continent a new nation: conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.</p>
<p>Now we are engaged in a great civil war ... testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated ... can long endure. We are met on a great battlefield of that war.</p>
<p>We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that this nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.</p>
<p>But, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate ... we cannot consecrate ... we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember, what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here.</p>
<p>It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us ... that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion ... that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain ... that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom ... and that government of the people ... by the people ... for the people ... shall not perish from this earth.</p>
