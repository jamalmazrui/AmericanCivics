**Welcome To The World of Free Plain Vanilla Electronic Texts**<br />
<br />
**Etexts Readable By Both Humans and By Computers, Since 1971**<br />
<br />
*These Etexts Prepared By Hundreds of Volunteers and Donations*<br />
<br />
<br />
December, 1972  [Etext #2]<br />
<br />
<br />
****The Project Gutenberg Etext of The U. S. Bill of Rights****<br />
*******This file should be named 2-h.htm or 2-h.zip******<br />
<br />
We apologize for the fact that the legal small print is longer,<br />
and more complicated, than the Etext itself, our legal beagles,<br />
of whom there are now a half dozen or so, insist this must be a<br />
part of any Project Gutenberg Etext we post, for our protection<br />
from the rest of the legal beagles out there.  The US has twice<br />
as many lawyers as the rest of the world combined!<br />
<br />
You are free to delete the headers and just keep the Etexts, we<br />
are not free not to post it this way.  Again my apologies.  The<br />
normal Project Gutenberg blurb has been deleted, you can get it<br />
in this location in most Project Gutenberg Etexts.  Thanks,  mh<br />

***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN ETEXTS**START***<br />
Why is this &quot;Small Print!&quot; statement here?  You know: lawyers.<br />
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with<br />
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from<br />
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our<br />
fault.  So, among other things, this &quot;Small Print!&quot; statement<br />
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how<br />
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.<br />
<br />
*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT<br />
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm<br />
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept<br />
this &quot;Small Print!&quot; statement.  If you do not, you can receive<br />
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by<br />
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person<br />
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical<br />
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.<br />
<br />
ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS<br />
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-<br />
tm etexts, is a &quot;public domain&quot; work distributed by Professor<br />
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at<br />
Illinois Benedictine College (the &quot;Project&quot;).  Among other<br />
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright<br />
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and<br />
distribute it in the United States without permission and<br />
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth<br />
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext<br />
under the Project's &quot;PROJECT GUTENBERG&quot; trademark.<br />
<br />
To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable<br />
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain<br />
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any<br />
medium they may be on may contain &quot;Defects&quot;.  Among other<br />
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or<br />
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other<br />
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged<br />
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer<br />
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.<br />
<br />
LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES<br />
But for the &quot;Right of Replacement or Refund&quot; described below,<br />
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this<br />
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all<br />
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including<br />
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR<br />
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,<br />
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE<br />
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE<br />
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br />
<br />
If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of<br />
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)<br />
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that<br />
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it<br />
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and<br />
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement<br />
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may<br />
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to<br />
receive it electronically.<br />
<br />
THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU &quot;AS-IS&quot;.  NO OTHER<br />
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS<br />
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT<br />
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A<br />
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.<br />
<br />
Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or<br />
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the<br />
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you<br />
may have other legal rights.<br />
<br />
INDEMNITY<br />
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,<br />
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost<br />
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or<br />
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:<br />
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,<br />
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.<br />
<br />
DISTRIBUTION UNDER &quot;PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm&quot;<br />
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by<br />
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this<br />
&quot;Small Print!&quot; and all other references to Project Gutenberg,<br />
or:<br />
<br />
[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this<br />
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the<br />
     etext or this &quot;small print!&quot; statement.  You may however,<br />
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable<br />
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,<br />
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-<br />
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as<br />
     *EITHER*:<br />
<br />
     [*]  The etext, when displayed, is clearly readable, and<br />
          does *not* contain characters other than those<br />
          intended by the author of the work, although tilde<br />
          (~), asterisk (*) and underline (_) characters may<br />
          be used to convey punctuation intended by the<br />
          author, and additional characters may be used to<br />
          indicate hypertext links; OR<br />
<br />
     [*]  The etext may be readily converted by the reader at<br />
          no expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent<br />
          form by the program that displays the etext (as is<br />
          the case, for instance, with most word processors);<br />
          OR<br />
<br />
     [*]  You provide, or agree to also provide on request at<br />
          no additional cost, fee or expense, a copy of the<br />
          etext in its original plain ASCII form (or in EBCDIC<br />
          or other equivalent proprietary form).<br />
<br />
[2]  Honor the etext refund and replacement provisions of this<br />
     &quot;Small Print!&quot; statement.<br />
<br />
[3]  Pay a trademark license fee to the Project of 20% of the<br />
     net profits you derive calculated using the method you<br />
     already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  If you<br />
     don't derive profits, no royalty is due.  Royalties are<br />
     payable to &quot;Project Gutenberg Association / Illinois<br />
     Benedictine College&quot; within the 60 days following each<br />
     date you prepare (or were legally required to prepare)<br />
     your annual (or equivalent periodic) tax return.<br />
<br />
WHAT IF YOU *WANT* TO SEND MONEY EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO?<br />
The Project gratefully accepts contributions in money, time,<br />
scanning machines, OCR software, public domain etexts, royalty<br />
free copyright licenses, and every other sort of contribution<br />
you can think of.  Money should be paid to &quot;Project Gutenberg<br />
Association / Illinois Benedictine College&quot;.<br />
